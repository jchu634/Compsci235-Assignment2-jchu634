5,25515988,aglecavalier333,The Memory Chair by Susan White is short emotional novel with lots of deep characters and a little magic. Narrated from thirteen-year-old Betony's point of view the story begins with Betony telling the reader how going to her great-grandmother is a sort of punishment she has to endure until one day she sits on her grandmother's large brown chair. "It was always the smell that hit me when I walked into the back porch of Gram's house. It was an overpowering smell musty and stale a smell that hung heavy in the air of the small cluttered windowless room." Betony gets a vivid dream of a family that resembles her own but decades before she is born. She is surprised by this dream and tries the chair during a second visit. She soon realises that these aren't dreams but are in fact memories of her great-grandmother when she was very young. The memories unfold a strange secret of a man - or young boy - called Warren whom nobody speaks of or seems to remember. Betony is intrigued and keeps trying the chair to discover more about her great-grandmother and this Warren person. "The memory of that day was Gram's. How did it become mine?" The memories also kindle a connection between Betony and her great-grandmother Ida bringing them closer. Betony also discovers the art of quilting and her great-grandmother previously portrayed as a scary old hag gets excited about it. "In just a week I had gone from totally dreading spending any time with Gram to the point where I eagerly rushed back into the living room so that I could hear more of what she had to tell me." One of the things I truly liked about The Memory Chair is the character development not only for the protagonist Betony but for her entire family. I like how the author made both young and old characters develop. My only objection was that there were a lot of characters and names and that often got confused. I felt like I needed a family tree. The novel is narrated by Betony but goes back to when her great-grandmother was a child which makes the novel span four generations *- all still living. Also Betony calls her great-grandmother "Gram" and her grandparents "Grampie" and "Grammie" so it gets a bit confusing at first or when they are all in the same room. "Gram is my Grampie's mother my mom's grandmother and my great-grandmother." - I had to read this sentence a couple of times to let it sink in. The pace is good neither too quick nor too slow. There isn't significant "action" but the shifts and progress are nicely done. I think it's a middle grade book but I'd definitely recommend it for all ages. "Each memory I had seen had brought me closer to Gram and now I cared about her in a way I had never imagined possible." The Memory Chair brought me to tears and I liked Betony's narration. Although there isn't a lot of imagery the book has many memorable quotes. "The way I see it Grampie being a family is like sewing this quilt together...Each little piece starts out separate. You choose two pieces to put together and keep adding to make on side of the first section. Then the second part comes together then the third then the fourth. Then you sew them around the middle piece and then you join them to another similar section. You start to see the connecting rings. Each little piece becomes part of the whole thing before it becomes a quilt." Note: I received a free copy of The Memory Chair by Susan White in exchange for an honest review and as part of a blog tour with Worldwind Virtual Book Tours.,4,1998-05-14 04:24:06
6,15710450,vikylka9696,This is a powerful story that teaches the lesson that following your dreams and ignoring your critics may be the key to happiness. Henri was certainly happy while making his paintings and he certainly had many critics to ignore during his time. Like many artists he was not appreciated until after he had died but HE appreciated his paintings while he lived and this is a fantastic and inspiring book. The art is very Rousseau-like and wonderful.,1,1965-03-28 14:32:21

8,2093969,mhaiyerlin6390,The Thirteen Clocks was a complete surprise. I was totally unprepared for the humor charm and quirkiness of this unconventional fairy tale. All the usual elements are there beautiful princess evil duke handsome prince magician advisors and supporting characters. None of them act in the expected manner they say strange things and behave even more strangely. I read it aloud to my daughter and I really think that it is a book that must be read aloud. She was often bemused by the dialogue but she liked it. Completely entertaining and not to be missed.,3,1957-08-05 05:02:31
9,10018414,killer26794,Short and to the point. Does not gloss over Reagan's faults nor downplay his accomplishments. If you want to read just one biography of Ronald Reagan and don't have much time this is a good way to go.,2,2009-05-13 09:36:08
10,18488643,beslangeroy,*copy provided by author in exchange for a honest review* Desire is the first book in the Seductor series. In this steamy erotica tale Jade is a seductor. She seduces powerful and rich men for things like; blue prints plans pictures whatever the job entails. Her job has always come easy. She's by nature a seductress. She seduces gets what she needs and the job is one that was until Oliver. Oliver is a billionaire with a powerful job. He's everything Jade needs and shouldn't have. This should've been an easy job for Jade but something about the way he does her body and her mind turns the "seductor" into the "seductee". Wilde is heavy on the steam in this first book. There is no "sexual stone" left unturned. The main character is a seductor after all. The writing was pretty well done. There were no messy hook ups or unbelievable clumsy rendezvous'. There's little world building but I think its done intentionally for the purpose of suspense and build up as this is just book one in what is to be a series. The characters are likable and the story is easy to read. There is a sort of cliffhanger at the end but nothing too drastic. It leaves you more curious than frustrated. I'm intrigued to see how the story plays out. Romance and erotica readers will enjoy this ride and be pretty eager for the next.,5,1953-06-21 02:45:44

12,17405342,philnunn,see full review @ Katie's Corner Have you ever wondered how your favourite anime or cartoons are made? Well to be exact how the voice actors are chosen? If yes this fabulous story is just for you! I have read it twice and both times I loved it a lot. Though it lacks a bit the romance declaration from the main couple. Yup in the whole 12 or so volumes there's not a single kissing scene. As you know I always hate when the romance manga doesn't have at least one kiss. However as you can see I loved it when I read it for the first time and even reread it for my liking. But let me start from the very beginning. Meet our heroine - Hime a high-school freshman in a very specialized school. Her dream is to become a professional seiyu meaning a person who dubs anime and video games. However there's a problem she has quite interesting voice and you'll need quite an imagination to recreate the sounds but trust me as soon as you start reading the voices of each character will be coming alive. You don't believe me? Bad for you you just need to start reading and you'll understand absolutely everything. The story focuses on how Hime got into the industry and fell in love with Senri. He's one great character and his story is something that develops fantastically and you want to know how his relationship with Sakura Aoyama (that's his mother) will go. To say the truth I wanted a bit more. I did love how Senri and Hime end up together but I wanted to see at least their wedding but nope I didn't get it. And plus I really wanted to see how Hime would act girl's roles so far she only did men's ones. So you are ready to get to know Hime Senri and Mizuki? That's another character that you really need to get to know better! Enjoy it to its fullest and don't forget to share your thoughts below! Stay tuned for more reviews as well as promos. Don't miss your next favourite book or manga! Happy reading! XOXO Katie,2,1971-12-24 10:02:03
13,27384500,kota1987,I was looking for a modern crime novel and had heard about Follow Me by Angela Clarke through some reviews. Helpfully via NetGallery the publishers sent me a copy to read and review. Overall I enjoyed it. I like books set in London and this book with plenty of London scenes created a good sense of place. Freddie the central character is a struggling graduate trying to break through as a journalist writing for free whilst also generating income sufficient to subsist by working in a St Pancras Costa-type coffee outlet was credible and well written. She is the best thing about this book. At regular intervals something happens and Freddie instinctively converts it into an idea for a short journalistic story idea many of which had me chuckling. Having taken some advice Freddie seizes the day and gets involved in a murder. The game is afoot. This particular murderer is active on Twitter where he earns the sobriquet "the Hashtag Murderer" and he posts clues online taunting the police and capturing the public's imagination. As the story progressed more and more implausible elements started to appear and these undermined my enjoyment. The plot is fast moving and the story is compelling so I was able to dismiss most of these implausibilities. That said the denouement borders on ludicrous as does a scene that immediately precedes it and these moments were a stretch too far. I have to confess I just flicked through the final 20 pages such was my sense of disappointment at these final developments. Follow Me is undemanding and fun (in so far as gruesome murders can ever be called fun) and there is much to enjoy in this ultra modern crime novel however the plot bears no real scrutiny. Taken on its own terms it's fine and there's much that is very good however it is let down by the more far fetched aspects of the tale. 3/5,5,1968-03-06 02:10:07
14,18338465,kepcon,I read Monster in His Eyes and Torture to her soul in the beginning of this year and fell in love with the characters and writing style so naturally I had to continue reading J.M Darhower's work...OMG I LOVED THIS BOOK! I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT ONE! I love Carmine & Haven they are just too adorable! The storyline is great although this is a work of fiction it makes you aware of the harsher realities of humanity.,1,1978-06-06 22:39:09

17,2250580,volkovroman1998,Midori's father makes robots and his latest is a "fun" robot that mimics human behavior more than any other has. This first book seems like a disjointed collection of short stories involving Midori and Vermillion and later Kira another robot who joins their happy family and how Vermillion passes for human among the outside world. Not terribly cohesive.,2,2017-09-28 16:30:05
18,18488643,rfvtgb1234,***I was given an ARC from Reading Bliss in exchange for an honest review*** Desire is the first book I have read from B.L. Wilde. Desire has it all a mixture of suspense romance erotica and of course LOVE. Jade Philips is a Seductor. She is half way through her ten year contract with The Seductors. So for the next five years they continue to own Jade. The Seductors is a secret business that has men and women who use their bodies and sex to get their clients the things they want. Jade is one of the best female seductors. She is given a new assignment that involves her getting close to Oliver Kirkham the CEO of a weapons company. From the moment Jade and Oliver and meet they are very attracted to each other. Oliver is making it very hard for Jade keep her mission on task. These two have an amazing chemistry. I liked Oliver a lot he was handsome rich sweet and kind yet he was a beast in bed. Man he could give more orgasms then most men. I really enjoyed his alpha in the bedroom side. Jade is independent smart and strong yet I felt Jade was hard to figure out. I kept rooting for her and Oliver. I wanted them to find their happiness with each other. Although I knew it couldn't happen yet because of Jade's contract. She just can't leave them until her contract is up or she will be killed. I enjoyed the plot also. I read this book in one sitting. I found it difficult to put down. One other thing is this book is full of sexy hot SEX! But I didn't feel it took away from the story. I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed Desire. I give it 4 stars. I can't wait to see where the next book takes us.,1,1954-01-20 08:22:44
19,28178571,blefiz1723,So far I'm loving Forget Me Not. Despite popular opinion I really like Yusuke who often makes bad decisions but is so open and introspective as he considers his past. As Yusuke has gotten older the women in his life become more detailed. Volume 3 moves much more slowly than volume 2 but given the dynamics of Yusuke Makino and Yamaguchi's relationship I didn't mind. Definitely a beautiful and engaging series.,5,1952-06-05 05:00:27
20,900084,nessco,"The Remarkable Record of Job" by Henry M. Morris isn't a commentary on Job but a look at several encompassing themes within. The main theme is God's Creation and how it ties in with God's message of Salvation. I found the book included several very interesting elements I'd never before considered. The writing style isn't anything special - it's rather matter-of-fact. Many many Bibles verses are referenced throughout but unfortunately they're from the King James Version so they're a little difficult to understand. Also there were a few oddities herein eg. references to Nimrod building Babel - this is highly unlikely as Genesis records Babel being a community effort and choice not justified under one powerful ruler. Also there were some curious beliefs about the behemoth and leviathan that I strongly disagree with and I think most people would find suspect. All in all this is a good book. 7.5/10,5,1958-04-02 16:08:10
21,10803536,pokrovskywx,This book is too hung up on the technical details and doesn't focus on character or plot. It's an interesting premise but when the characters are cardboard and their motivations cheesy and wafer-thin it just doesn't hold the reader's interest.,4,1984-12-08 00:12:21
22,18777580,mikeevenson,Meh. I just don't care for this author I guess. The community reviews led me to believe it was going to be an extraordinary romance. I thought it was commonplace and smutty. There is little build up to the relationship before they're all over each other and the same tired old sexual references are supposed to titillate but are boring and overused. I don't mind a little sex as long as its liberally sprinkled between a lot of story. AND you can care about the characters.,4,2018-10-02 01:58:46
23,6670541,shnyra88,I really wanted to like this book more. I have enjoyed the previous two installments. I felt that the characters were all only half-way fleshed out. I have liked that in the previous books she uses the local and culture to really give the books an exotic feel and to teach about the culture but I was dispirited in this one as Singapore didn't really stand out. Most of the characters are only half-way fleshed out and stereotypes. There are some bright spots. There is a sympathetic sub-plot about homosexuality and how it is looked down on in by many in Singaporean and Indian culture and the difficulty of being a gay man there is a part about the harsh drug laws and the hypocrisy of the police looking the other way to protect western ex-pats who use drugs while harshly sentencing natives who sell the drugs to the westerners. Also there is an execution by hanging at the end that was quite well written and poignant. Well I am going to give the next book in this series a try and hope this one was just a bump in the road. These books have been enjoyable lighthearted (for the most part) mysteries set in an exotic local written by a native and I recommend them to anyone who wants to get a day to day look at life in Malaysia and Singapore.,4,1990-01-19 04:26:51

28,872645,ksayros2,First thing I think of this book: Totally awesome. Lulu the kicking and up Poker Player Girl isn't exactly the best candidate for being the stepdaughter of the Mayor of NYC. And no I'm not talking about this guy. He's married already you see. Although the Poker Diaries is a rather short book (hence the short review and because of the writing competition I'm in starts with a 'n' and ends with an 'o') it's actually quite awesome because of 1) the main character and 2) Lulu's dads both of them which is future dad and current dad. Guess who is which? I totally recommend this book to people who need to read a quick read and not be so dedicated/faithful to it because The Poker Diaries is a cheesy read. Cheesy doesn't even tell it all. The plot is crazy. I'll tell you the fast version of it. First we meet Lulu's real dad who happens to be on the wrong side of the law (very important part of the book). Then we meet the Mayor of NYC who really is killing the numbers on crime. Two dads on two sides of the law. Can it get any worse? Oh yes. Yes it can. Someone named Dack gets into the wrong crowd. Really bad crowd. Lulu ends up playing in a poker game to save Dack's butt. Then she gets blackmailed by someone because they have a footage of her talking about illegal poker games and stuff like that. Yeah. It can really go far especially when the police gets involve. But that's a little ahead of the story which I will not talk about. Because that's spoilers. Rating: Three out of Five for being ridiculously Cheesy Cheesy. -ofpaperandwords.blogspot.com,1,2004-12-02 23:15:10

31,18338465,mraupp,Rainy Dayz Reviewz Author: J.M. Darhower Genre: Contemporary Romance; Young Adult Source: NetGalley- Gallery Books 530 pages So much happened in this book I'm not sure where to start. This book encompasses so much. It's not just about human trafficking. It's not just about the mob. It's definitely not just any young adult romance. I feel silly saying it but I had a hard time starting this book. I was expecting something set in South America and that there would be a lot of violence in the book. There was some violence but the story of Haven and Carmine make up for it in spades. There were so many twists turns and surprises in this book it blew my mind. I found myself getting anxious thinking my gosh what can happen next? By the end I was so totally engrossed with the book that I read for 4 hours straight to finish it. Haven was born a slave. I thought since reading the synopsis that since she was a slave this book was set in another country because we aren't supposed to have slavery anymore in America. The book starts out in California where haven has lived for her 17 years. Just as there are all kinds of other illegal activities after reading this book I can believe that there are still slaves. That thought is very upsetting. Haven has spent her entire life secluded from the outside word. Her views on things are sometimes very funny in their simplicity. Haven gets taken from the house in California and her mother at the beginning of the book and is taken to a new house in North Carolina to live with the DeMarco's. She has to adjust to a whole different life and her journey was interesting to read. There are 2 DeMarco sons. Dominick and Carmine. Dominick is your regular high school student. Carmine is just a mess there's no nicer way to put it. He's seen some terrible things in his 17 years and in addition to that is considered a mafia prince. He drinks and does drugs a lot. He gets into fights with everyone. But he can't understand why Haven doesn't like him. The changes in Carmine once he decides to be nice to Haven and try to get her to like him are great. The relationship between Haven and Carmine is one of the best I've read in a book considered Young Adult. Why do I say the book is "considered" Young Adult? Well it might be categorized as that since they are technically both 17 and then 18 in the book but there is drinking drugs sex and violence in this book. I would say that it should be considered New Adult despite their ages. The topics that this book covers are something that I'm not sure that many teenagers would be able to understand or enjoy. When the book finished I thought to myself huh I think there could be a second book... and there will be. Apparently Sempre is book one of the Forever series. Book two is called Sempre Redemption and I'm sure it will be even more action packed than the first book. Its publication date on Goodreads is December 23rd. Picking a few favorite quotes has been difficult with this book. I highlighted a lot! Favorite Quotes: "Colpo di fulmine. The thunderbolt as Italians call it. When love strikes someone like lightning so powerful and intense it can't be denied. It's beautiful and messy cracking a chest open and spilling their soul out for the world to see. It turns a person inside out and there's no going back from it. Once the thunderbolt hits your life is irrevocably changed." "The girl who had never been able to call her life her own taught a boy who had the world at his fingertips exactly what it meant to live.",3,1975-01-04 14:15:26

36,18338465,clifton233,3.5 Buddy read this one with my beautiful sissy Pearl. Finally I was able to read this book! I've been eyeing this book since it came out but never got the chance to actually get a copy and so when I did I read it immediately the experience was more fun since I have someone to buddy read it with. Mafia + Love Story is a sure recipe to capture my attention. I've been craving for stories like this. I am sucker for great romance with a lot of action you know the damsel in distress kind with a knight in shining armor but in a realistic and modern setting. The book's premise was screaming all the right things I've been looking for in a book so I succumbed and read it. Did it hold its end of the bargain? Partly yes. Was I a tad bid disappointed? Well let's just say this book wasn't what I completely expected. Has it turned out to be a bad one? Definitely not it was a good book but then I was maybe looking for something else. I know my expectations got the better of me - again. The book started out really well I could say this because the only way I could gauge a good book is when I was engrossed by it the first 100 pages. It captured my attention and I was able to read a substantial amount of pages in just one sitting (which doesn't happen a lot these days because I have the attention span worse than a 2y/o) so I thought I'm in for a great ride. But as the story went on the pacing seemed to be slower than what I would have liked. I wanted action and heart stopping breath taking scenes but all of this only happened during the latter part of the book around 10% or so towards the end. So that was kind of a little disappointing for me because it was a book concerning mafias it is just natural to expect a lot of actions but alas there were only a little of it. I would like to say that the focus of the book was more on the love story of Carmine and Haven i'm saying that this isn't necessarily a bad thing however it could have been better if the mafia part was played out well. I love the love story though it was cheesy when it needs to be and serious when the circumstances asked for it to. I loved how consistent the characters were. Carmine who had a bad temper but turned out to be more patient and understanding because of Haven and Haven who was the shy girl at first but came out of her shell to open up. I loved how their characters developed and who they have become towards the end of the book. I loved how it centered on family too how important love is and would take extreme measures just to protect the ones they love. Sacrifices had to be made betrayal for a greater good it was a mixture of good family values and human frailties making the readers kind of relate to the book. I felt it the emotions that the book was trying to draw out from its readers and I couldn't discount the fact that not many books can do that. I also appreciated the fact that it wasn't too explicit or with contents that would make a reader cringe such as excessive use of profanities or abusive situations that one can not begin to fathom. I have read my fair share of books with explicit contents and I am glad that Sempre did not dwell on that completely I'd say I expected it in this book but this book proved me that a good book doesn't need to have explicit contents to be a cut above the rest. The reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that I was perpetually lost and confused what with all the characters there are so many! I seriously had a hard time figuring out who is who and their relation to each other. I literally had to write down the family tree and whatnot just to keep up to what was happening - but even doing so I was still left with too many questions if anything I was more confused than I already am. There were a lot of loose ends. I had a lot of questions and I thought the last chapters will wrap it up but then it just served to add more questions to my already lost mind. I want to put every question I had in this review but then it will become a spoiler so I'd rather not spoil you of anything. I guess I would have to keep it to myself and just read book 2 to find the answers I've been desperately craving. So there's that. Also there are parts that the book can certainly do away with. I guess the author could have condensed the book into a shorter one and not make it more than 500 pages. I understand that this was the debut novel of the author but the book can really do some polishing leaving out really important details that would make the book more coherent. And oh I would love to read more of Vincent and Maura's back story I wish the author can do a novella of some sort. That would be amazing. And also I wish there was more backstory as to what happened to Nicholas and Carmine I was left wanting more. Maybe let's put it this way I wanted to see the whole back story of everything of how everything really came about. There was something lacking something I need to get a grip on so the story would come out real solid. Let's see if Sempre Redemption could give me the satisfaction I needed. All in all this was a good read and I could recommend it even to younger readers (okay not super super young but enough to decipher the message the book wanted to convey). And of course I will be reading more of JM Darhower's works I heard her other books are just as gripping if not more. Looking forward to it!,3,1981-11-09 07:16:22

39,2168737,robben96,A collection of stories about the THing on his own away from the Fantastic Four after he has struck it rich. Along the way he learns money can create as many problems as it solves who his real friends are having a dog helps make life better and that women will make you do stupid things. LOts of old school comic book adventures good use of FF history really nice art Slott has a solid handle on the thing as a character and the message issues get their point across without hitting you over the head. Shame this was such a short lived series as it was a consistently good read. Be interesting to see someone try and capture this magic/formula and give the other members of the FF their own series and see if it work work or if the Thing is just special.,1,1954-06-13 19:21:49

41,11455127,superw,http://www.blue-moon.fr/spip.php?arti... Mieux vaut-il ne pas avoir froid aux yeux pour lire le second tome de la serie de Lacey Alexander mais si vous avez deja decouvert le premier vous le savez deja. Dans la collection Passion Intense il y a eu un net coup de chaud depuis quelques mois et ce tome illustre parfaitement le ton. Nous sommes plus dans l'erotica que dans la romance erotique. Ici l'histoire d'amour n'est pas centrale ou elle l'est d'une maniere subtile c'est davantage une etape dans la vie d'un couple. Ils vont se redecouvrir lors d'un week-end brulant organise par un mari pour l'anniversaire de son epouse. Ethan et Mira sont maries et globalement heureux meme si le travail du jeune homme fait que leurs relations se sont distendues depuis quelques mois au point que Mira se pose beaucoup de questions.Conscient de cela et du fait que son epouse a des fantasmes qu'ils n'ont pas experimente encore Ethan a une idee tres particuliere de cadeau un menage a trois avec un autre homme qui n'est autre qu'un ex de Mira. Un dangereux et seduisant week-end se profile alors car cette experience ne sera pas sans consequences. Ne cherchez pas une intrigue plus elaboree ou des rebondissements a n'en plus finir tout est dit. Ethan Rogan et Mira vont explorer les potentialites du liaison a trois et decouvrir ce qu'ils veulent  leurs limites respectives ce qu'ils veulent vivre dans leur vie privee ulterieure. Les scenes de sexe sont tres nombreuses tres longues detaillees et entrecoupees uniquement de reflexions des differents protagonistes sur ce qu'il se deroule. L'experience est interessante car chacun attend quelque chose de different. Pour Mira c'est une surprise et elle si accepte ce moment elle va se pose beaucoup de questions. Jalousie fantasme realise ou pas jeux dangereux avec le desir l'amour tout est mis sur le tapis a travers ces scenes brulantes. Si l'histoire est moins exploree que dans le premier tome et si ce questionnement est un brin previsible l'issue est interessante et les scenes effectivement tres erotiques n'ont rien de gratuit. Voila donc un intense roman erotique qui n'explore pas vraiment la romance mais davantage la relation d'un couple qui s'ouvre pour la premiere fois a un autre protagoniste. Mieux vaut savoir que ce roman est brulant et que vous y croiserez des situations ou les heros sont rarement seuls dans leur lit ! Mais si ce genre de lecture vous interpelle Lacey Alexander maitrise parfaitement son sujet et apporte des reponses aux questions que se posaient Ethan et mira au depart.,3,1995-12-19 20:02:20

43,23626289,neelaeva,Inhalt: Daemon hat seinen Bruder Dawson zuruck aber Katy hat Dees Freundschaft verloren. Und auch Dawson ist nicht mehr der alte. Er hat es sich in den Kopf gesetzt seine Beth aus den Fangen des VM zu befreien. Aber sie werden beobachtet und Dawson totet kurzerhand einen Agenten. Als dann plotzlich Blake auftaucht ist das Chaos perfekt und vor allem Dees Mordgeluste gross. Aber gerade er scheint die einzige Moglichkeit zu sein Beth zu befreien und Dawson vor dem sicheren Tod zu bewahren. Konnen sie ihm vertrauen? Meinung: Nach meiner Begeisterung fur Daemon und Katy bin ich um den dritten Band naturlich nicht herumgekommen und erhoffte mir insbesondere eine weniger jammrige Katy als noch zu Beginn von Band 2. Vorab zur Entwarnung: Die habe ich bekommen. Der Einstieg in Katys Blogger- und Lux-Welt gelang erneut wie von selbst. Kleine verstreute Ruckblicke gaben mir die notige Erinnerungsstutze und ich konnte mich ganz auf das nachste Problem konzentrieren oder besser die Probleme. Denn neben Dawson der seine Beth zuruckhaben will ist Katys grosstes Problem die komplett zerstorte Freundschaft zu Dee. Die hat naturlich allen Grund wutend und enttauscht zu sein aber dennoch ist Katy wie vor den Kopf gestossen. Doch zumindest in einem Punkt lauft alles gut: Daemon ist sich seiner Gefuhle nun endlich so sicher wie Katy und ich durfte den einen oder anderen romantischen Moment mit ihnen verbringen. Hier eine kleine Anmerkung: Durch die Auslassungen fur ein Jugendbuch dachte ich mir eigentlich jedes Mal es" ware schon getan aber irgendwie ... nicht. Aber das war auch kein Problem sondern wollte nur erwahnt werden. Was ich hingegen schade fand dass die beiden durch die nun eindeutigen Gefuhle einiges an Biss verloren haben. Die schlagfertigen Dialoge sind nur noch selten vorhanden die Spruche nur noch ein Schatten des ersten Bands. Dadurch fiel mir mehr auf dass Jennifer L. Armentrout uber nahezu jede Kleinigkeit berichtete. Details die mich gefuhlt am Fortkommen hinderten was ich sehr schade fand denn der Schreibstil selbst ist locker und leicht wie eh und je. Naturlich steigert sich die Bedrohung und so kommt dennoch Spannung auf Ruckschlage und Tote mussten in Kauf genommen werden aber das gewisse Etwas fehlte einfach. Zug um Zug drangte sich dieser Eindruck immer weiter zuruck und die Spannung kletterte auf schwindelerregende Hohen - bis die Autorin den dritten Lux-Band mit einem absolut fiesen Ende abschliesst. Hoffentlich vergeht die Zeit bis Origin - Schattenfunke" ganz schnell. Urteil: In Opal - Schattenglanz" fuhrt Jennifer L. Armentrout ihre Geschichte um Katy und die Lux gekonnt fort. Leider blieb der von mir erhoffte Biss der Dialoge grosstenteils aus und deckte so einige ereignislose Stellen auf die mich am Vorankommen hinderten. Die stetig ansteigende Spannung der nervenzehrende Showdown und das herzzerreissende Ende belohne ich dennoch mit 4 Buchern. Die Reihe: 1. Obsidian - Schattendunkel 2. Onyx - Schattenschimmer 3. Opal - Schattenglanz 4. Origin - Schattenfunke (Erscheinungstermin: 18.12.2014) 5. Opposite - ? (Erscheinungstermin nicht bekannt) (c)hisandherbooks.de,2,1969-12-13 10:06:36

46,16110527,matveev74,I think this is the first time I've given a self-published book a five star rating. I found "Never" through a blog scavenger hunt the author did to celebrate the book release. When I downloaded the free sample I didn't know what to expect. The sample definitely hooked me. Travis Hamilton a scholarly young man is an unlikely suspect for murder. When he is convicted and sentenced ten years labor in Dead Mines his brother Ross is determined to clear Travis. Ross knows his brother cannot survive the sentence and he knows Travis is not the murderer. But the web of deception is more tangled than either brother imagined. As their journeys increase in difficulty both brothers turn to moral convictions that must "never" be abandoned no matter what the cost. Can Travis survive the evil rule of the mine boss? Can Ross reach the bottom of an ever deepening mystery before it's too late to rescue his brother? Some of Travis's experiences in the mine might make this book unsuitable for young children. I'd give it a PG rating. That said this book was refreshing. Even in Christian fiction it's rare to see heroes sticking to what they believe as tenaciously as Ross and Travis. The author did a wonderful job showing principled good winning over unprincipled evil. I'll be looking forward to reading more from this author.

49,27384500,maxguk,The main part of this story is that somebody who is later dubbed The Hashtag Murderer puts cryptic clues on the internet which indicate his or her next victim & which taunt the police. The murderer captures the public interest and his followers rise. The problem being that as his total amount of followers rises so does the body count. Freddie is an investigative journalist with a particular expertise in technology & computers. Nasreen is an ambitious detective who is striving to prove herself. Freddie & Nasreen must work together to try to stop the murderer whilst both try to come to terms with an incident from their past. (Eight years ago Freddie & Nasreen were involved in a traumatising incident.) This really is a well written debut crime thriller. It is a modern tale of how dangerous the modern world & technology can be. Throughout the book there are little hints about the events of eight years ago and a time goes on the full story emerges. The characters were well written realistic & believable. Nas was suitably annoying in that she initially treated Freddie like dirt and she is ambitious so she would creep up to management. I warmed more to Freddie who had idealised views and she hadn't moved on much from her student days. Freddie was not afraid to let her emotions show. The Hashtag Murderer was suitably creepy and scary. The identity of the Hashtag Murderer was a surprise when he/ she was unmasked as I guessed completely the wrong person. This book is full of twists turns & red herrings. Reading this was a bit like being on a rollercoaster ride with lots of ups & downs & stomach churning moments. It is frightening to see how criminals (& their crimes) have evolved and how they can easily make use of the latest technology. 'Follow Me' is the first book of a new series and on the strength of this novel the author is destined for great success. I loved this book and would recommend this to anyone. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.,3,1975-02-06 16:09:49
50,32606520,disinter,I decided to read this book because I rarely read cowboy romances and I needed a change. I really enjoyed this story. It was a quick well written book. Kanen was my favorite character. He had a tough family life growing up and never felt good enough but he was a caring unselfish person. Chastity suffered heartbreak and lost everyone she loved and Kanen was just what she needed. He made her believe in love again and Chastity was the one person who loved Kanen unconditionally and could care less about what he could offer her. The H and h fit together perfectly and gave each other a sense of peace and belonging. I would have liked a longer ending to see how their conflict was resolved instead of having it wrapped up in narrative in the epilogue. Overall I really liked this book and would read more by this author. I voluntarily reviewed an Advanced Reader Copy of this book.,4,1993-07-19 01:12:44
51,18071375,hlyubovjbuh1983c,**received a copy for an exchange for an honest review** There is so much potential in this series. I did find it a little slow to get into at first but once I did get into it it was a good read. What really hooked me was the cliffhanger now I really want to know what happens between Ana and Jake not that her mother's back in the picture. There was a lot of hot scenes between the main characters and they did have a lot of chemistry but I felt that the action sequence for the crime was a little hurried and predictable for me. Another thing that I found was that there was quite a bit of the spelling errors grammar punctuation etc. Usually I just look over these but there was too many that it bothered my when I was reading it.

54,18338465,doregon,* I received a copy in exchange for an honest review * I was pretty surprised reading this. It's been on my TBR shelf for a while but I never was interested enough to pick it up just yet. Thankfully I pushed it up to on my TBR shelf when I received this book. I really enjoyed his book it was a dark read but with plenty of romance. I never read a Mafia book I was always hesitant but I really liked it in this book. It's a pretty long book around 520 pages. It worked int his book because you get invested in the characters and find redeeming qualities in people which wouldn't have been so obvious in a short story. The characters in this book were not easy to like sometimes. They would sometimes act like bad guys then good guys. Most of them really stick with you and you feel their pain (I did tear up a little) and their joy. I really liked the sense of humor in some parts of the book it wasn't too much but it made the book not so dark ( yes I did laugh out loud and people looked at me funny). Some parts of the book were kind of slow and I had to put it down but after a while I would want to pick it up right away. Overall I really liked this book. I really liked the writing the humor the darkness the vulnerability of some characters and the deep subjects like slavery mafia and glimpses of death. I would really recommend this book.

59,15801518,BigLar,Good book. Nicola has taken the job as a nanny to get away for awhile. Her fiance broke up with her to marry her best friend and she just can't deal with all the sympathy right now. Nicola is going to take this time to get her life in order. She didn't expect to fall in love with the two little girls or be so attracted to their father. I liked Nicola and Cade. Nicola has taken the initiative to get away for awhile and also take that time to work on the things she wants to change. I did notice immediately that she has some real self-esteem issues. Much of this was caused by her mother's attitudes but some were caused by her broken engagement. She also had a real lack of Christmas spirit because of it. I loved the way that she immediately took to the kids. She was great with them and seemed to know just how to deal with some of their problems from their mother's desertion. Her attraction to Cade was something she didn't want to deal with but it wasn't going away and he was feeling it too. Cade did a great job of helping her face her feelings and was also able to get her to enjoy the Christmas season. Nicola was also envious of his close family and really enjoyed being a part of it over the holiday. By the time Christmas was over she knew she had fallen in love with Cade but also realized that he wasn't ready. When she went home she was sure she'd never see him again. Cade was definitely a tortured hero. He had been devastated by his wife's desertion and now had no intention of falling in love again. He was immediately attracted to Nicola making him feel things he hadn't felt in a long time. He also like Nicola the way she was and couldn't understand why she didn't. I liked the way that he seemed to be able to see what she needed and was able to help her with it. I really enjoyed seeing him try to make this Christmas so wonderful for his kids. I also enjoyed seeing him show his love for them so much. He was falling in love with Nicola but hadn't let go of his past. When he proposed to Nicola it was for all the wrong reasons and when she turned him down he was surprised. I really liked the way that Nicola's refusal made him take a good look at himself. I liked the way he came to her at the end.,4,1956-08-18 01:30:44

63,6744290,farzi,Este e o terceiro e ultimo volume que inclui contos do Regresso de Sherlock Holmes nesta colecao e era tambem o ultimo livro desta colecao que tinha por ler. Abaixo fica um pequeno resumo dos contos incluidos neste livro. Charles August Milverton - A personagem que da nome a este conto e o maior canalha de Londres de acordo com Sherlock Holmes porque se dedica a intercetar missivas privadas e a usa-las para chantagear os seus intervenientes. No inicio desta historia o dito visita Holmes porque as cartas de uma jovem prestes a casar com um conde chegaram as suas maos e Holmes ira tentar negociar com o homem. So que este mostra-se implacavel e a dupla Holmes/Watson tera de recorrer a outros expedientes para resolver o caso. Um bom conto mas que nao achei memoravel. O Atleta Desaparecido - Godfrey Staunton e o melhor jogador de raguebi do pais e na vespera de um jogo importantissimo desaparece sem deixar rasto. O treinador da equipa de Cambridge onde Godfrey joga procura Sherlock Holmes antes do jogo pedindo a sua ajuda para encontrar o jogador desaparecido. O facto de ser o melhor jogador da equipa e de ser ao mesmo tempo herdeiro de uma enorme fortuna fazem Sherlock desconfiar que tudo esta relacionado mas a verdade acaba por ser revelar inesperada. Apesar da surpresa no desenlace final achei-o desinteressante e anti-climatico pelo que este nao foi dos meus contos preferidos. A Granja da Abadia - Sherlock Holmes e chamado por um antigo conhecido seu para investigar um aparente assalto que resultou na morte do marido e no ferimento da mulher. Quando Sherlock chega ao local ouve os participantes no caso e investiga a cena do crime descobre como e costume que os indicios apontam numa explicacao bem mais complicada do que a mais obvia. Um conto ao nivel dos dois anteriores que nao me cativou muito pelo facto de ter adivinhado os contornos do crime antes de terem sido revelados pelo detetive. Contudo gostei do final. E com este livro termino de ler a colecao Sherlock Holmes que saiu com o DN/JN no verao de 2009. Essa colecao tinha 12 volumes nos quais se incluiu ao todo 32 dos 56 contos que sao considerados no canone do detetive: - 10 dos 12 contos de As Aventuras de Sherlock Holmes - 10 dos 12 contos de As Memorias de Sherlock Holmes - 9 dos 13 contos de O Regresso de Sherlock Holmes - 3 dos 7 contos de O Ultimo Adeus de Sherlock Holmes - 0 dos 12 contos de The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes Para alem dos contos distribuidos em 10 dos 12 volumes desta colecao temos ainda 2 dos 4 romances que Arthur Conan Doyle escreveu com o famoso detetive Um Estudo em Vermelho e O Signo dos Quatro. Por isso e facil perceber que quem ler esta colecao ira apenas ler pouco mais de metade do que foi escrito sobre Sherlock Holmes. No entanto para quem como eu nunca tinha lido nada sobre o detetive foi um bom comeco. Gostei de um modo geral das historias que li; uma vez ultrapassada a estranheza em relacao a personagem e aos seus modos e meios de deducao acabamos por sentir alguma afinidade com Sherlock e de achar piada a sua relacao com Watson. Apesar de um ou outro problema com estas edicoes e de nao conterem todas as historias do detetive pelo preco que me custaram chego a conclusao que compensou.,5,1970-09-23 17:16:19
64,18338465,goldbond,STORY 4 stars PERFORMANCE: 4.5 stars OVERALL: 4 star STORY I had very high hopes that this'd be dark erotica while listening to the first half of this bookyet I was wrong; this book is far from dark and is not erotica. Perhaps I'd consider this an "edgy romance" but even that's questionable since the story is a bit tame to be considered edgy. There is a very dark premise that could have created an extremely dark depraved book had the author provided descriptions of the sexual and brutal ask experienced by some of the characters get 95% are fade to black. SEMPRE's overall storyline is great yet sporadically peppered amongst the greatness were some events or happenings that were completely ridiculous since they were way way too coincidental. For example in the very first sentence of chapter 42 it states "bookcases towered above Haven like skyscrapers". Even though Haven is surrounded by what sounds like thousands of books she just happens to select the one and only book out of many that has a letter written about her secretly hidden inside of it!?! A "coincidence" like that is disappointing to me especially after reading the rest of the book which shows how capable Darhower is. At times the story dragged on some containing quite a scene few scenes that could have been shorter or completely omitted. All in all though it was an entertaining story and I do plan on reading the sequel. PERFORMANCE: Female narrator Carla Mercer-Meyer provided a fabulous performance. She was consistent throughout the book with tone pitch etc.. My only complaint about her performance was that she mispronounced several words. I wouldn't be surprised if many people struggle to properly pronounce the word "lackadaisical" or the vehicles brand "Audi" but when you're a narrator it's your job to research this.,4,1981-11-03 01:42:59

66,18588529,edivaldo,Perfect for Halloween! A great story to read this time of year! Brandon moves to a new house with his parents and his brother. Immediately something seems off: strange cold air streams from an unidentified source a neighbor kid who tells a scary story about a kidnapping that happened in the house when it was owned by the previous family and a few other things. The story is believable because these events happen gradually and each one could have an innocent explanation. But it doesn't as we soon find out. And that's when the story gets really interesting.,1,2019-11-15 08:28:35
67,18071375,des1gnxmas,So I really liked the premise of this book. I enjoy romance thrillers so this was another plus for me. But it sort of fell flat in that area. It was like a small background story and then when they got to the juicy part of that it was over rather quickly. The whole guy was going to be the step-dad thing was sort of freaky but they are really close in age so it's not like it was a he was 60 and she was 17 kind of creepy you know what I mean... So the main character Ana moved to the states when she was 11 yet she still seems way too British to have been living in the states for 11 years. I get her mom is also British and so she probably retained a lot from that but I've known people who had similar stories in real life and are way more Americanized. So what I'm saying is really that the way this characters speaks just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Also a lot of the characters who are American use the same terms and way of speaking which really doesn't make sense. So I would've preferred for the vernacular to have been fitting to the characters. Also maybe it's just me but the whole Alpha male thing just didn't come out right for me here. I like a good alpha male character but Jake just came across as more of an asshole with douche bag tendencies instead of the sexy confidence that I like. The steamy scenes while steamy came off as cheesy because of the words that were coming out of Jake's mouth. honestly I skimmed a lot of them to get back to the main story. Also the book needs some more editing but it wasn't anything too bad as far as that goes. All that being said I'll read the next book because I must find out what happens!! The ending was a cliff hanger.,5,2000-09-05 18:37:23

70,18777580,anapolack,This book was well written with very likeable characters. It is about love lost and pain starting over after losing so much. I felt there was a little too much information given on what was going on in the characters heads. That may be the reason I just could not get into this story. It was not a bad read but for me the words did not flow easy. The character feel so much and the author does put a lot of feeling into her writing. The characters mind wander a lot and I think that is where the author lost me I can't put my finger on just why this book just doesn't do it for me. The characters very believable the love scenes are wonderful and I really like the characters but something is missing. Sam loses his mother at a very young age he never gets over this for his mother was his world. She understood his very sensitive nature stood beside him through his OCDC is what I think he has. He tries to be everything to everyone and if he lets the little things go then his world falls apart. Forcing on the little things he wears his self out and can't get the big picture which in returns leaves things by the way side. This partner sends in off to volunteering at an urban green-space farm hoping to get him out of her hair why she gets the clinic going for he is driving her nuts. In comes Nina who has a story of her own. She is the daughter of a migrant workers who has come a long way from the fields to live her husband's dreams. Her husband was killed her husband in Afghanistan (I get a little confused here because the author talks about him getting killed over there and later on about getting out and dying from some kind of illness. But I could have missed read this part as I said I had a hard time getting into this story.) She has gone on and built a wonderful business which is going well. Her husband was her everything she grew up with him and has spent her time waiting for his return her whole life. The loneliness has always been hard in years past but she knew he would be coming home. When he doesn't return she feels like she is still waiting for him knowing she is not. She does have a few sexual times only to have the convert of a warm body. Sam and Nina have many issues and they are determinate to find the strength to see them through. Together they make a lovely team with helping each other find their way to a loving and last relationship. Finding away to bring their families back together as they learn to love again. This book about their past lost and coming together. There were a lot of funny and cute things. "When you look at me you screwed up your face. Are you having a stroke?"(This is on their first meeting and she is trying to get the better of him. Her friend has told her what a control freak he is.) "Am I having a stroke?" "Because I saw this thing on TV about recognizing the warning signs of a stroke and I think rudeness and ugly faces were on the list. And possible planting petunias in the middle of July in Ohio but I could be wrong about that one. "and the scene with the hat where she is trying to get him to wear the dirty molded hat was very cute. They have a lot of funny lovely spats. I loved the scene where his friend comes over and they spat back and forwarded about why he was there and how life was. There are tons of very cute scenes. I am giving this book a 4 star for the reason I couldn't get into it and the author lost me along the way. Just because this book doesn't do it for me doesn't mean you won't love it. The reviews on this book are outstanding we can't all like the same thing.,1,1950-06-18 08:56:46
71,17183712,Antonieth15,I think this is more "mommy porn" than fifty shades. I don't usually like to compare books to Fifty - but I think the author opened it up for comparison when she named the book and advertised it. It's obviously more tame in the BDSM department but is still a little freaky. I guess my biggest problem with the book was just the ridiculously sudden onset of Alexandre's affection. I mean he took her rock climbing gave her a chaste kiss sent her a gift disappeared for a week came back and jumped her bones. I feel like there should have been a slower onset of his affections - I also don't really enjoy books about cougars. Maybe someday I will but I'm 23 and not really worried about it at this point in my life. This book isn't bad but I would recommend it more to an older crowd - kids in your twenties - maybe pass on this one for now.,1,1994-09-25 20:44:15

74,2373197,242233,Esta e a historia semi auto-biografica sobre um judeu hungaro de 15 anos e as suas experiencias nos campos de concentracao de Auschwitz Bunchenwald e o menos conhecido Zeit. O relato das atrocidades e feito de forma cadenciada numa escrita simples e directa num relato sem dramatismos surpreendendo pela conclusao de que na vida as coisas sao como sao e que a nos resta viver. "Posso garantir que nao ha nada mais penoso que mais desanime do que verificar e assistir dia apos dia ao que morre em nos." Depois da libertacao: Perguntavam-nos se vinhamos de um campo de concentracao e interrogavam muitos de nos incluindo a minha pessoa para saber se nao encontraramos por acaso um familiar que se chamava assim ou assado. Disse-lhes que nos campos de concentracao as pessoas na verdade nao tinham um nome.",4,1993-10-09 16:33:04
75,18488643,tlgredman954,When I read the blurb for this book I have to say I really was not convinced. I wondered how the author was going to be able to make the lead female Jade come across as anything other than an expensive hooker. I was very pleasantly surprised. Jade is viewed as the number one seductress in the agency hence why she gets put on an assignment worth $5million. She has never had a 'Big O' from a client while on the job but all that changes when she meets her next target Oliver Kirkham. He manages to get her hot and bothered at the slightest touch. The problem she has is that others in the agency notice the changes in her will she be able to complete the steal and walk away? It may be that she has fallen in love with the one man who will be targeted to die if she gives in. This was different to a lot of the romance books out there at the moment so it came as a nice breath of fresh air. I really felt for Jade's character and am intrigued as to what her back story really is. Oliver well I fell in love with him myself and could not help but feel for him and the inevitable conclusion that was to come you knew it was only going to end in one of two ways neither being a HEA. I am intrigued as to how the author will continue with this series will she revisit Jade and Oliver somehow or will that be the full stop to their relationship and a move onto other Seductors. I for one will revisit to find out the answer to this! Please note I was given a copy of this book in return for an honest review.,2,1972-06-15 07:09:19
76,15710450,armanserow,This wonderful new biography of a self-taught man who started his art career late in life and with little recognition also attests to determination and persistence amid criticism. As Henri Rousseau follows his dream to paint he finds the path he has chosen to be a sometimes lonely one. The text describes his love for nature and his reliance on the 1889 World's Fair in Paris for inspiration but despite his hard work critics made fun of his work. The text is engaging filled with sparkling phrases that evoke Rousseau's own paintings as the author describes how Rousseau sees that "the sun is a blushing ruby all for him" (unpaged). She also captures the painter's total immersion is his work sometimes becoming "so startled by what he paints that he has to open the window to let in some air" (unpaged). Of course Rousseau has the last laugh on all those critics who dismissed his work since their names have been long-forgotten while his and his work live on attracting new admirers and continuing to influence painters today. The acrylic and watercolor illustrations are just as stunning as the text a loving tribute to a painter who never could afford to travel to the jungles for which he and his paintings are now so well known. It would be hard for me to choose a favorite page since I loved them all.,3,1967-12-23 12:05:24
77,17183712,altindish,Review: 4.75-weapons of mass destruction-stars Follow Me: www.thebookenthusiast.net www.facebook.com/thebookenthusiast I was hooked on this book from the first page. Hot steamy shocking many WTF moments and oh have I mentioned the hot and sexy Alexandre! Holy smokes he is off the charts in soooo many ways! Pearl is 40 and kind of lost and feeling alone. She works in a producer of documentaries and is given an assignment that brings face to face with Alexandre. The sparks between them were flying immediately. I found myself reading with a big smile on my face because their flirting and Pearl's inner thoughts were so funny. Pearl is just too much throughout the book. Between her nicknames her antics and her intense emotions for Alexandre it was difficult to put this book down. I lost many hours of sleep because I would say "just one more chapter" and that chapter led to one more and another (you see how this goes) and before I knew it it was 3am. Now I have read A LOT of books and it is pretty hard to shock me and trick me but Arianne Richmonde you did this with The Pearl Trilogy. I had many *mouth hanging on the floor* moments and yelling WTF to no one in particular because I was just so surprised as to what I was reading. I swear you won't see it coming. This book is filled with hot and steamy scenes but it is also filled with a great story that will have you rooting for Pearl and Alexandre as a couple. You learn some really important things about their pasts which shed some light on why they are the way they are. This Trilogy was originally release as three separate books (40 Shades of Pearl; Shadows of Pearl; and Shimmers of Pearl). The release date on Amazon for both paperback and e-book is on the 23rd. Towards the end there was a bit of a lull but nothing that prevented me from not continuing on. I loved this book/series and recommend that you read it.,5,2005-09-09 12:45:37

79,1059682,cgrimes,It's Ray Bradbury of course I loved it! He has a magic way of wording things that make perfect sense but delight the mind and soul in their unusual metaphors. I had read a few of these chapters in other short story collections as each chapter can stand alone. A story about a very unusual family reunion.

83,12369705,THROTTLE,This book is very different from any angel and demon book I have read. The story is centered on the lives of the guardian angels and the demons known as "Sheydims" in this novel. I loved the perspective that we were given on how people's guardian's angels are chosen. I also loved how Heaven was portrayed. It was also equally interesting to see how "hell"; the underworld where the Sheydim lived was portrayed. Let's just say I don't want to end up there!

85,18777580,ksyushakostko,The second in the Burnside series by Mary Ann Rivers Laugh focuses on the eldest Burnside Dr. Sam. A fair amount of ground work into the personality of and dynamics between the Burnside siblings was set up in book one. It was already clear that Sam was fiercely protective of his brother and sisters and felt a very strong responsibility for them. In this book we learn a lot more about why Sam is the way he is and lot more about the neighborhood clinic he and his friend Lacey are launching. I have to say getting to know Sam's history was nearly my favorite part of the story. Perhaps because I could relate to a lot of his feelings? I really enjoyed the romance between Sam and Nina a CSA farmer and entrepreneur. Rivers somehow managed to keep it comedic and fun even though much of the courting was shrouded in some serious issues on both sides of the relationship. I would recommend reading this series in order for the best effect. I received an e-galley of this title in exchange for my honest opinion. The views expressed above are my own.,4,1990-11-06 22:02:43

88,18071375,daoneny,I loved the story. Definitely an emotional roller coaster for me. I wasn't sure about Jake and his 'caveman' ways. At times he seemed to be over protective dominating and down right bossy. His character was in general was good. Ana was a great character. I enjoyed her personality. The other characters in this book were quite good. This book was a good thriller/suspense. I gave 'Take a Breath (Take 1)' 4 stars due to the ending. But over all a recommended read.,3,1971-06-28 02:23:52
89,18488643,1960ChevyBelair,What would you do if your job was seducing unsuspecting people for someone else's gain? How would you handle allowing a target cloud your judgement towards the job that you're on? These are some of the questions that Jade is faced with after working for a secret organization of Seductors. Over the past 5 years she has gotten really good at her job and it makes it so much more easier that she actually enjoys what she's doing. Jade finally gets the one case that is almost too much for her to handle she's given that task of retrieving some sensitive information from Kirkham Industries CEO Oliver Kirkham. So I have to be honest and admit that when I actually grasped all what being a top Seductors really was I kinda felt like they were just super spy-like prostitutes. Ok so it wasn't kinda that's what I thought and I'm really having a hard time thinking otherwise. Jade has a true talent for getting what she wants and does not feel guilty about her position one bit. Things changed when the Seductor was seduced by the target. After her first encounter with Oliver Jade was never the same. Jade couldn't believe just how simple it was for Oliver to take over her thoughts and do things to her body that she never thought possible. I liked Jade she despite her focus and loyalty to her job she has a conscience and for me it made her more human. Oliver Kirkham is different from most of the overly wealthy alpha males that I have been in many books that I've read as of late which is refreshing. Despite his primal desire for Jade he's not stalker like and far from that I need to control your every move syndrome. As I progressed through Desire I was on the edge of my seat wondering if Jade would complete her mission. On some level I was hoping somehow circumstances would change where Oliver would not get hurt. I actually developed a soft for him. While Desire did come full circle it still had that cliffhanger vibe. I got to the last page and almost passed out. I wanna know what happens now. So almost immediately I looked to see when I would be able to get my greedy hands on Vol. 2 I learn that I have to suffer until June 2014. Now I have a pouty face.,4,2010-06-13 20:21:38

91,12369705,cy8,Debuting author Theresa Sneed chose an ambitious project for her first novel a spiritual fantasy titled No Angel and I'm pleased to report that it delights on many levels. Sneed's No Angel opens in a heavenly realm moves into mortality where good and evil spirits impact humans and then she thrusts her readers into a frightening underworld where even good spirits can become trapped through error. Each world is filled with complex characters and governed by strict rules--rules Sneed's main character a reluctant Guardian Angel named Jonathan Stewart hasn't bothered reading. Jonathan was sorely disappointed by his own mortality and in an effort to make this second earth experience (required by all post-mortal spirits) quick and painless Jonathan selects an EMD client Early Marked for Death knowing his client will die young allowing him to complete his assignment early and quickly exit earth once and for all. What Jonathan failed to learn from that unread handbook is that special conditions surround the exceptional spirits assigned to be EMDs--their goodness makes them prized targets of the dark spirits. Jonathan's poor attitude is a disappointment to the more dedicated Guardians but more importantly it also places him in the cross-hairs of dark spirits who pose a threat to his successful completion of his mission and to Faith the child he has been sent to guard. But Jonathan has two allies a loyal Guardian Angel named Grace who takes a special interest in him and Celeste Knight the premortal spirit of Faith. Their interest in Jonathan is not accidental. Sneed does a wonderful job of fleshing out heaven and the underworld with rich vivid description that drives the theme of good versus evil deep into the reader. Still the book is not dark and eerie. Sneed successfully slingshots between humor and drama during Jonathan's bumpy spiritual evolution providing a change of pace that makes this book suitable for YA as well as adults while also endearing this disgruntled soul to the reader. Without those humorous passages No Angel would have been a dark eerie tale. And though that was not Sneed's purpose in writing this book she proves she has the talent to go that direction if she ever chooses. The explanations of the rules of each world slow the read in places but they are essential to the ensuing tension and there is plenty of tension which intensifies until the conclusion which leaves the reader unsure about the outcome of many of the characters until the very end. No Angel is fiction but its powerful themes of good versus evil spiritual promptings choice and accountability family friendship and loyalty make it a valuable springboard for family discussions on these topics and therefore makes this book one to be read together as a family and worth having in a family library. This is a first-rate read that quickly earned Theresa Sneed a Whitney Award nomination. Sneed is a talented writer who should find No Angel a contender for Whitney's "Best Novel by a New Author" award. She is already completing a second project proving that great things are ahead for her and those who pick up her imaginative tender books.,4,2010-08-29 01:32:58
92,35598457,ilyinston4ik,I was recently given the opportunity to read this book in exchange for a review. The description of this book sounded really like something I would enjoy and I was right. I read this book in a day and Katie and Julian quickly grew on me. Right from the start you feel for both of them. I can't imagine the grief Katie is going through and what Julian must be feeling when his family falls apart. Reading from both POV really made me understand them more. I loved the fact that they already knew each other was really nice and more so with the fact that it wasn't instant love again. They were actually really careful of the other in the beginning. I appreciated this. It happens too often in books that they're instantly in love in less than a minute. The only thing that bugged me about this book was that the time seemed to fly by. A jump of a few months happened at times and that made me feel like we were missing certain things. Other than that an amazing book that made me want to jump in the second book right after. More descriptive review will follow on thebookdutchesses.wordpress.com,3,1970-10-06 18:17:44
93,1059682,mzmccray,I'm not entirely sure what to think of this book ... I mean it was interesting -- always enjoy the 'otherworldly creatures of the night' kind of thing -- but I guess it read more like a series of connected short stories than an entire novel. Which isn't BAD just not expected I suppose. Although reading the author's afterword the book began as various short stories published in different magazines so I think Bradbury essentially did some creative weaving. I like that this edition has the artwork done by Charles Addams (yup that Addams -- of Addams Family fame!) and that Bradbury and Addams had communicated about this set of stories before they saw light because it totally reminded me of the Addams Family in a way. Also in a vague sort of way (probably to do with the main character Timothy being a 10-year-old mortal boy amongst other creatures) it reminded me of Gaiman's Graveyard Book (which is awesome by the way). Anyhow. I feel sort of bad for not liking it more as it won a National Book Award. But I like this blurb about it (it's what hooked me in the first place I think): "High on a hill by a forked tree the House beckons its family homeward and they come--travelers from the lyrical lush imagination of Ray Bradbury. From the Dust Returned chronicles a community of eternal beings: a mummified matriarch who speaks in dust; a sleeping daughter who lives through the eyes and ears of the creatures she visits in her dreams; an uncle with wings like sea-green sails. And there is also the mortal child Timothy the foundling son who yearns to be like those he loves: to fly to sleep in daytime and to live forever. Instead his task is to witness the family's struggle with the startling possibility of its own end.",5,1992-01-31 22:32:18
94,18338465,kazakova81,Tbh i don't have much to say about this. It's a big meh to me. I liked the characters enough but there's nothing special to it? It's a story about two younglins trying to find themselves and their place in the world while holding each part of them together. They are broken hurt and trying to survive. Carmine is angry and talks shit to everyone doesn't have a care in the world. He lost his mommy and the mafia expects him to join even though they always give him a choice. Haven is a slave she always was a slave until they got her out of there but she still is a slave when they fall in love. She doesn't know a thing about the world. There are other characters most of them cold killers. There's violence and mentions of rape. It's a story about sacrifice and love and surviving. So yeah if you think that's the kind of story that you would like go ahead and read it. Some things in life only happen once the memories lasting forever. They are moments that alter you turning you into a person you never thought you would become but someone you were destined to be. There's no magical rewind button in life no take backs or do-overs to fix things you wish you could change.,2,1994-09-19 23:30:17

96,18338465,BethBZ1,35 A great book !! Haven had been a slave for all her life until she is "taken in" by Dr. DeMarco to live with him and his two son. It's time for Haven to learn what real life is: healing hope happiness and love in the arms of Carmine DeMarco. But while her life finally seems to be taking a new turn the shadows of the Cosa Nostra's intrigues are never far away ... A MUST read: there is humor tenderness fear love horror ... We laugh we cry we shudder with the characters and we always ask for more !! The characters are incredibly complex particularly Haven that we see evolve throughout the book from the scared little slave to an extraordinary young girl. One regret: starting from half of the book I thought it's dragging on a bit but fortunately the last chapters rectify it.

97,1662762,hillbillytattoo,Like the other great American genius writer Throne Smith his spiritual brother H. Allen Smith is many ways the PG Wodehouse of the Screwball era. A rich eccentric millionaire dies and leaves all his wealth and real estate to his pet cat Rhubarb who like his owner is fussy and kind of mean. And he also owns a baseball team. So in this book you get zany zany characters - everyone from a muscle bound daughter to crooked lawyers to dopey baseball players to an occasional bad dog or two (sorry dog lovers). If you mixed Howard Hawks comedy with a side dish of Throne Smith and a touch of small-town Manhattan you got "Rhubarb."

Danielle the daisy follows along the same lines as the others which a special surprise towards the end in the form of Rebecca a girl who happens along and comes to their aid. Rebecca was a nice surprise and change to the story. I've said it before and I'll say it again with so many seven book series it's amazing that the authors were able to get them unique. That being said reading them in a row as we have been doing can start to grate on the nerves. We're going to continue reading the Fairy books but from now on it'll be one series at a time with breaks in between. Fourteen books in a row is just too much for Mommy. :-),3,2011-07-01 13:00:06

I'll be chewing over this for a while I think. Now if only more of Huysmans books were translated into English. Highly recommend it. Now the reason this is such a good read is that it plays between comedy and tragedy serious and satire so brilliantly. The writing is immaculately sharp I found myself laughing constantly but also with my mouth open at the disturbing nature of what Houellebecq is implicating.

104,2093969,sileas,What an absolutely fun book. I expected it would be because Neil Gaiman wrote the introduction for this (and brilliantly included it in In the Cheap Seats so I could actually hear about it) but it really was more fun than I expected. I can definitely see how it influenced his writing because it really had a Gaiman-esque feel to it... even though it was written long before Gaiman became an author. Funny enough I took his word with this book. In his introduction he included an anecdote about how he managed to make a friend laugh who was going through a rough time by reading a book to them. Tonight it's storming. I'm also being forced to write this in a Word document because the internet's down so I can get out what I want to talk about before I forget since this is such a short book. Not an unforgettable book but I know I'll forget what I want to say and how I want to say it. ANYWAYS. It's storming. One of my dogs is terrified of storms. I took this book downstairs with me to find her and curling up in a dog basket I read half of it to her. She calmed down and went to sleep same with our other dog who isn't as terrified of storms. Basically this is dog and human approved. It's a short book and it has a delightful story with characters that are very fun. A lot of it reminded me of The Princess Bride (with the tone of writing) or Monty Python (with the jokes). Give it a try. I'm sure that you'll enjoy a story about a cold Duke a minstrel in disguise a warm Princess slain time and a Golux.,1,1989-03-12 13:32:26

111,25435220,ltdtg,In the mood for a new SFR author/book I skimmed the Kindle Unlimited selections in the genre and found Sue Mercury. I read Step Alien: A Sci-Fi Alien Romance first and the action in this novelette takes place just after that story. I liked this one a little better - H/h were decently fleshed out. Prince Joseph is so long a widower he doesn't even recognize with the mating fever strikes him after meeting Angie. The book is just 50 pages so keep your expectations for plot development and characterization in line for a story of that length.,3,1972-01-24 06:09:39

Henri Rousseau picked up his first paint and brushes at age 40 then continued to annually submit paintings to Salons around Paris to great ridicule personifying persistence. Charming illustrations in which Rousseau's real paintings are cleverly edited to present the story as it moves from artistic unknown to well-loved "naive" artiste friend to Pablo Picasso & Gertrude Stein. The text is middle grade friendly but full of life and effervescent vocabulary.,4,1974-11-26 13:38:07

This tale is full of gothic intrigue and lots of secrets! The Goodwine family is back in prominence and so is the danger that haunts Amelia.

114,16130164,avrtrans,4.25/5 Stars Blood Warrior: Dragon King by Lindsey Piper is the second full book in the Dragon King Series. It deals with the adventures of Tallis of clan Pendray and Kayva of clan Indranan. Oh you haven't read the Dragon King novels? Then let me back up a step or two. The Dragon King paranormal novels center around five clans of the dragon king. The dragon kings are descendants of the Great Dragon. No they aren't actually dragons but they are supernatural beings with extraordinary powers. There are five clans Pendray Tigony Sath Indranan and Garnis and each have their own unique abilities. These beings look human and can blend and exist within our human society. Also each clans lineage and history have become part of worlds mythos. The clans are broken up by regions and the powers they posses. Tigony of the Mediterranean region would be the Greek gods and goddess and the Roman and Greek mythos that surrounds that region of the world. The Tigony control electricity i.e. Zeus's lighting bolts. The Indranan clan centered in the Asian Pacific and gave rise to the mythos of that region. The Indranan control the mind and they are telepathic but they have a violent past. Each Indrana is born a twin and they believe that in order to get their full dragon gift of telepathy they must kill their twin. So as soon as they come into their power usually during adolescence they hide from each other. The Sath is the clan most closely associated with the Middle East and would have influenced that region's religion and mythos. The Sath dragon gift is mimicry they are seen as thieves by other clans. The Pendray are the clan that influenced the Norse and Celtic myths of Valhalla and the Ulster traditions of myths. The Pendray are known for their fighting ability the mythos of the berserker is most closely related to them. They are seen are little more than animals. The last Clan is Garnis they are so few in number that they are known as the lost not much is remembered about them. These are the five clans of the Dragon King that have guided and developed civilizations up until the present. But now they are a people on the brink of extinction because they can no longer bear children. The second book Blood Warrior starts shortly after the events of the first book Caged Warrior which set the premise of the Dragon King series and the fringe world that they inhabit. Some dragon kings choose to live among humans but most prefer to live within the confines of their own communities. Tallis the main male character in book two was first introduced in book Caged Warrior. He has been on a 20 year quest for the 'Sun' a goddess who has been guiding him through his dreams to influence dragon society by killing certain dragon kings in order to make the world a better place for their people. ButTallis has become disillusioned with the goddess and has gone out into the world to seek her out for retribution. The book starts out with Tallis finding the 'Sun' goddess in India high in the Himalayas'. Tallis eventually finds the 'Sun' goddess and her name is Kavya but not everything is as it seems. Can you even trust yourself when dealing with a telepathic society. What I liked about this book. I liked the way the two main characters have to learn to communicate with each other as Kavya is used to dealing with Indrana people who use their minds to communicate. Verbal communication isn't her strong suit and neither is using her body to show emotion or feeling. She isn't used to having to read body language and pick up on the physical cues of another human being. She is confounded by Tallis because she cannot read him. She can read anybody else's mind but to her Tallis is a blank slate. Tallis has also lived in human society for the last twenty years and is more animated with facial expressions than most dragon kings. Tallis is tormented by what he has done by the guiding of the 'Sun' he thought he was working for the greater good of dragon kind. The realization that he had sacrificed twenty years and countless lives for nothing has pushed him to the brink of madness. The conviction that Tallis has been living with has fallen like a house of cards and he needs to confront the source of his manipulation. Blood Warrior is a heart pounding adventure from the very beginning. The paranormal world that Piper writes is fresh and so multi-layered that stories arcs and characters will be plentiful. The concept that each clan has a special gift and are prejudiced against one another because of preconceived notions is something that will be exciting to explore. How they will survive extinction because conception has stopped is question that is a series arc. Book #3 Hunted Warrior is our in 2014 and the preview of it had me on the edge of my reading seat. Piper has written a unique and riveting series and I can't wait to read more of her series.,1,2009-06-02 15:19:48

124,1059682,martcopy,I quite enjoyed this. It's a story about a rather unusual family who live in A House. Everyone in this family is like said a little unusual in their own way. One can fly one can become invisible etc. etc. But most important: they can't die! However this family took in one ordinary human boy and this is the interesting story about him meeting his family and dealing with the unnatural: to make the choice to become like them undead or to remain mortal. I really liked finding about individual characters' stories even if on the whole the story felt a little disjointed. But Cecy was very nice so I'm happy she was quite heavily featured! Plus what I really liked was the moral in the story (here there be a quote that may be spoilerific but which I really enjoyed) : Timothy: "Well are you all happy? I wonder about that. I feel very sad. Some nights I wake up and cry because I realize that you have all this time all these years but there doesn't seem to be much that's very happy that came of it all." Great Grandmere: "Ah yes Time is a burden. We know too much we remember too much. We have indeed lived too long. The best thing to do Timothy in your new wisdom is to live your life to the fullest enjoy every moment and lay yourself down many years from now happily realizing that you've filled every moment every hour every year of your life and that you are much loved by the Family. Now let us get ready to leave." I just really liked the message in this. I had not expected it but the moral made the entire book so much better for me.,4,1973-09-24 19:15:52
125,17183712,holita,First off I am a sucker for a kindle daily deal book. Secondly I hate the name of this book. It's just a blatant rip off of Fifty Shades of Grey when it doesn't need to be. It was an enjoyable book and the sex scenes were hot. The "cougar" concept got me thinking. I hated how the main character had nicknames for her genitalia it was just juvenile and made me cringe every time. I'm looking forward to reading the other two books in the series.,5,2001-07-18 21:22:55

127,18338465,ogdenp,Sempre is the first book in J.M. Darhower's Forever Series. This is a well crafted emotionally charged thriller that kept me flipping the pages. Mafia families are at war; human trafficking is an organized crime competitive business and slavery unfortunately is a reality. If crime stories full of betrayal deceit love and sacrifice is your passion then Sempre is the book for you. The story begins with Haven a runaway slave being captured and sold to Dr. Vincent Demarco a mafia consiglieri. As consiglieri Vincent has to fly to Chicago often and meet with the Head of the Italian Mafia. Much to Vincent's dismay this head of the mafia family is the Godfather to his son Carmine and has declared to everyone that Carmine would become a Mafia Prince at age eighteen. Vincent hopes that Carmine declines his Godfather's offer because if he doesn't there will be no leaving the family business alive for him. Carmine is a brazen spoiled seventeen-year-old male with a crass mouth which he allows to rip whenever the mood strikes him. He's a womanizer and treats women with disrespect. Carmine has every intention of joining the family mafia business until a slave-girl enters his life and turns it upside down. I love it when I discover a new talented author. J.M. Darhower is a fantastic story-teller and a razor sharp writer who captures the essence of raw emotions that can stir and move a reader. All of her characters are well developed and realistic. I even love Carmine the selfish brazen teenager. You will too; just wait and see. I highly recommend giving Sempre a read it's just too good not to.,3,2006-04-30 17:30:19

129,18338465,gsjonesinc,5 stars!!!!"Don't let them break you. Don't let them win. Fight the fight. It's the only way to be free." Where do I even start? I actually read this book back in 2014. Two years later and it still has my heart racing. Sempre was filled with sooooo many great and memorable characters.I am fighting the urge to write my very own SparkNote analysis of this novel hah. No worries I'll spare you that pain but I will tell you a bit about Sempre's fantastic four: Haven Carmine Vincent and Corrado. These four will burrow their way into your heart whether you'd like them to or not. Especially Vincent and Corrado (my absolute fave in this series). Although this series is mafia-themed Sempre focused more on Haven and Carmine--their innocence and their budding romance. You should see the number of tabs I used for all the cute shippy scenes (I almost used up an entire sheet of pink ones!). Haven and Carmine are opposites that attract. She's soft-spoken. He's short-tempered. Their relationship growth was a glorious slow burn. It started as curious interest to an unlikely friendship to more. My cheeks hurt because of how much I smiled or grinned from their interactions. Freedom is continually brought up in both Sempre and Sempre: Redemption. Despite the fact that she was bought by Vincent (Carmine's father) she's freer than she was before entering the DeMarco household. You can imagine how incredibly complicated Haven and Vincent's relationship was throughout the novel. There were times I wanted to punch Vincent while screaming 'HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?'. Is he a good guy? A bad guy? He's always kind of walking the line and blurring it. It's evident how loyal he is to his true family though. He's stuck in the life but he'll do everything it takes to keep his two sons from going down the same path he did. It's this characteristic that made me sympathize and come to love him. What can I say I always fall for the bad guy hah. I found myself comparing Vincent to Corrado (brothers-in-law) countless times too. To me they seemed like two sides of the same coin. They're so similar and yet so different. Corrado prides himself in being a respectable made man whereas Vincent almost seems reluctant to follow orders. It's a strange dynamic but one that works incredibly well. To summarize the characters of Sempre both the main and secondary characters were phenomenal. And story-wise. I was hooked from start to finish. Yes Sempre is a beast of a book [a little over 500 pages with the paperback] but every moment is worth it! READ THIS BOOK YOU ARE MISSING OUT.,1,1986-06-18 16:15:22
130,2093969,jshojvg,A cute fairy tale with a prince a princess an evil duke frozen clocks spies and magical helpers. One of the great things about the story is the sound of it -- Thurber's writing gets sing-songy at points and often has open rhymes too. You can just imagine how great this story would sound being read out loud to a child. Marc Simont's illustrations also make for a good fairy tale book. Plus the paper of this particular edition feels lovely -- thick paper that's smooth and almost glossy -- and the font is nice and large. This would be a great book for a child to pick up and touch and look at.,2,1969-05-31 18:23:37
131,18071375,terlen64,DNF at 15% As previously commented- this just isn't well written. The idea of the story intrigues me but the lack of editing and sub-par writing kills it. I couldn't get past all of the issues even though I tried. I'm not happy about that either- as I really am curious about where this story could have led. Ms.Author find a professional editor an English teacher or even an honest friend to read and mark the numerous mistakes. You also need to remember that while you may be British most of your characters aren't. You need to keep that in mind when writing American characters. As most of them came across with that British quirkiness that us Americans love (but only in the correct setting) More work needs to be done to clean this up. Better luck in the future.,2,1953-01-30 16:20:36

133,18338465,stormalong,I've been wanting to read Sempre already for quite some time. Firstly I was attracted to the cover cause it shows passion and danger at the same time which is honestly what happens inside the book. Secondly the synopsis seemed really interesting. And lastly even though I don't usually take it into account the goodreads rating where pretty impressive. So I have to say that I started reading Sempre with some pretty high expectations and I have to say the book really achieved them. I liked the whole concept behind the story because it brought a new edge to the romance in the book. The whole time I was reading the book I was going back an forth wanting to know what was behind all the mystery with the Mafia and also I wanted to see the romance evolve between the 2 main characters. In Sempre the characters are really deep that I didn't knew what was going on in their minds half of the time. Other books decide to focus just on the main character but in Sempre J.M. Dorhower also developed and showed the secondary characters as well which made it an even more reliable story. I really liked Carmine he is pretty messed up in the head well more like confused and he tries to get it all out with his rude behaviour. That's it till Haven arrives in his life and he stars realizing that there are more important things out there. Watching their love story blossom was amazing and I can't wait to read the second book in this series.,3,1986-01-24 15:45:15
134,18777580,bondik1994,I'd been paging through beginning of books hoping something would hold my attention when I remembered - hey I've got a Mary Ann Rivers book to review. I am so dumb. I should have read this earlier. Then I wouldn't have been despairing of having anything GOOD to read. Laugh is Sam's story and I had to wonder how she was going to take such an unlikable character and make me want to cuddle him. For the most part Rivers succeeded. Sam's still mostly a jackass. He gets frustrated easily and the words get dammed up in his mouth and when it comes time to actually talk to the people he cares about he only succeeds in pissing them off more. He's also cocky beyond belief and his energy level is incredible - he can't sit still. But there's an explanation for all of this and over the course of the story we learn there's a method to Sam's madness. After story upon story of twenty and early thirty somethings finding love it was a welcome change to read a story where the main characters have actually lived and know what they want. The impression I got was Nina was more afraid to let go of her widowhood and everything it represented than what Sam could give her. She'd made a life for herself all by herself and entering into a new partnership meant an end of sorts to that life. And their first date? Loved it. Loved how awkward it was both of them trying to please the other and not entirely failing. I think I might have blushed in sympathy for the both of them. Sam's relationship with PJ got enough page time that I'm hoping his story is next (please please pretty please?) I do wish there had been more between Sam and Sara. I still felt a little in the dark about how their relationship had fallen apart by the end of the book. The other downfall of Laugh is those lovely detours Rivers takes weaving in the backstory were sometimes confusing. It was like she lost the thread of what she was actually trying to say and it took me a while to figure out oh THAT'S what she meant. But that's not going to keep me from reading it again.,2,2003-08-24 08:36:51
135,18488643,lcerchie,Oh Hello! I feel I have to start off by telling you guys that I had no idea what to expect when I picked up Desire. I had been told of B.L. Wilde as a fan fiction writer but with everything going on I hadn't had a chance to actually read her work. When I get review request I pick them based on if I find them interesting which I know sounds redundant but you'd be surprised by how many bloggers accept requests just to get the free book. I was a little bit unsure at the beginning I knew the blurb I read sounded like a really interesting take on a suspenseful romance but I was a little worried. I didn't have a reason to be. The book opens with Jade half way into a ten year contract with what amounts to a clandestine organization that. You want something stolen they are who you hire. The difference between them and let's say mercenaries? These guys use sex to get what they want and Jade is the best they have. Her next mission is an easy information grab or it should have been. Oliver her mark however makes it increasingly difficult to keep her objectivity. One of my favorite things about this book is the way Jade never apologizes for what she does. She starts out the book as a woman who is completely at peace with what she does. It would be really easy to end up hating her but B.L. does a great job humanizing her as the story progresses. As the reader you never feel like the development is rushed it all happens very naturally. B.L. does something really smart with Jade when she makes her self aware in certain situations. She is fully aware that Oliver has feelings for the Jade she created for his benefit and not who she really is. And Oliver is kind of endearing. He is very sweet to read and the whole time I personally wondered how he would act if he was dealing with the real Jade and not the one tailored to him. Besides great characters we get a great plot. A really fast paced story that once you start you'll find difficult to put down. Be forewarned though there are some seriously steamy scenes in here. B.L. does not pull punches when she writes sex scenes. I will say they are for the most part tasteful and always in place with the story. You wont really find a sex scene just for the hell of it. There are even a few places we get a fade to black moment which is great because they just would have been sex for the sake of porn. For those of you that have read my reviews before you know how I feel about cliffhangers. That being said that is pretty much the only reason this isn't a five star review. Don't get me wrong the cliffhanger is done really well I just need to know!!!!!! While the story itself isn't predictable as you're reading it once you finish you absolutely look back and think "Well of course that's what happened". I don't know about you guys but to me that's a good story. I was so involved with the story as it was happening I couldn't spare a second to try and figure it out before the end. Bottom line is if you like a little suspense with your romance you should definitely pick up Desire. I know I'll be picking up book two which I hear is in the works as you read this. Happy Reading ~Notte,1,1952-05-13 05:37:08

138,18338465,virgo54,*I received a copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you so much!* It was a life of crime a world of violence where danger constantly forced its way in. It was a world that turned men cold and cynical as they did unspeakable things she couldn't fathom. I'm very glad that I requested this book on Netgalley. I would have missed out on a great book. Sempre is a clash of genres combining an epic love story high school romance mafia crime novel and a story about a slave girl on her way to freeom. This is a very emotional book. I was choking up numerous times throughout the first 10% of this book already. Darhower described Haven's situation with cool and simple words. The way Haven talked about her own destiny almost detached and totally accepting. It was frightening and so very sad. But when asked once what she was most afraid of she answered it was hope. And then I understood. When she comes to the DeMarco household she can't believe yet that things might be better for her. But she eventually gets to know Carmine and Dominic the sons of her new master. And let me tell you there hasn't been a hero like Carmine before. He's hilarious so very cynical totally messed up closed-off to his family and hurting inside like hell. I enjoyed the way he and Haven got close and fell in love. There are so many great and complex characters in this book. There are hardly any truly bad guys. You might hate some first or they might scare you. But then Darhower gives you a closer look at them and few are ever how they appeared first. Carmine's father Vincent is the best example for that. The world Vincent lives in is almost indescribable. It's so dark and brutal every false step leading to death or torture. It was depressing and shocking in many ways. This novel might be about young adults but it's certainly not for teenagers. Sempre is a dark honest and starkly beautiful story about modern-day slavery and the power of love. Everyone with a heart for romance novel should read this book! I'm eager to read the second one soon. I'm so glad Darhower decided to write a sequel. Because as much that I loved those characters they're still so young and broken. There's so much they need to learn so much healing they need to do. I'm glad the author gives them the chance to do exactly that in Sempre: Redemption. The last question left is why I gave it only four stars if I liked this book so much. Well it breaks my heart to say that but I was actually bored a lot of times throughout this book. It has some lenghts and there were many scenes that weren't necessary for the plot or character development which could have been cut out.,4,1967-03-27 21:26:08

So far it has been about her meeting the robots and some of the things they can do. Also a scientist that they used to trust they can no longer trust.

143,16130164,golantarm,Getting a glimpse at Tallis' story was a pretty fun adventure. He really is that jerk kind of guy that you still fall in love with. He's crude and vulgar and kidnaps her for goodness sake but at the same time he protects her. Tallis starts out wanting revenge and he wants to make Kavya suffer but in the end this turns into a sweet and desperate love story. I will say that I don't recommend reading this as a stand alone. I think you need to at the very least read Caged Warrior to get a better understanding of the Dragon Kings but either way Blood Warrior is a great read. Despite Tallis being a beserker he isn't all violence. He's super funny and sexy as hell and just an all around love-able character. I'm glad that after getting a glimpse of him in Caged Warrior that we were able to see him more in Blood Warrior. Watching the relationship between Kayva and Tallis unfold had some intense moments to say the least and Kayva's brother is a murderous nut job but that just made the story that much more intriguing. Piper creates a paranormal world that is unique and exciting. This is not your typical PNR book. Blood Warrior and the entire Dragon Kings Series will take you on an adventure of epic proportions. Believe me when I say it isn't something you want to miss!,4,1998-10-13 01:58:51

145,2093969,gulnur83kg,A fairy tale of sorts this book was a fun read and I'd imagine even more fun to read aloud. The plot is simple enough but still clever. It is written in almost a way as to not be completely understood using made up words like zatch glurp and slish. The characters are delightful! Like The Golux "the only Golux in the world and not a mere Device" or The Todal "looks like a blob of glup makes a sound like rabbits screaming and smells of unopened rooms. It's an agent of the devil sent to punish evildoers for having done less evil than they should." I think the main character starts off very witty and clever then depends too much on the Golux. But the evil duke becomes increasingly funny throughout the book. After finding out about the name of the main character: "The Duke's sword had begun to shake. 'Nobody ever tells me anything' he whispered to himself." I would recommend this especially to younger children and to parents of younger children.,3,1950-09-10 14:40:40

152,19322550,andbarman,Ok so apparently I spoke too soon and jinxed it :( We are back were we started jumping through volumes with no true purpose or vision. I am 100% confused. We are given tidbits and content that we already read. When we finally get some fresh content we turn the page and see an excerpt for another Ferro novel then we are asked to leave a review. Asking eager upset readers for reviews when they are looking for content might not be the smartest thing. I am now apprehensive about reading volume 13 because when will 14 be out? o.O The story line is still intriguing and the endings definitely leave me wanting more. Literally. o.O We make another cross between series and go back in time to Jonathan's novel. We get to spend some time with Sydney and Peter whom I still believe has the best series within the Ferro family series. I was left wondering though if I need to start reading Trystan's story because chunks are now missing. While they don't affect this story much they sure would help. A little twist at the beginning of this novel has me breathing better since the last installment but that ending just had me crazy once again. I am confused and this whole series isn't getting clearer. A little clarity at the end of these volumes would be wonderful. Just once! I have lost count of time but I doubt this series has span a year yet if even six months. One thing this series has going for it is it's secrets. I know none nor do I have any idea. This is all one big mind game that seems to tease you as we progress. A saving grace for volume 13 is that it will initially be from Sean's POV. I have been craving that since I met him in 'Damaged'. There is not much difference between this volume and the last. We have literally moved on a couple hours again and obviously a team of ninjas are after Avery and Sean. Let's see how it progress. As it stands this series has yet to change direction or style. I can probably plot the next volume and how it will end. My opinion take at least a month break between these novels so it doesn't feel like you are wasting your money. Who knows by then they might be on sale :),4,1957-12-10 19:09:16

155,18488643,aglecavalier333,Sex is power and to a Seductor power ensures success. Jade Phillips loves her job and is the best at what she does. She's spent the last five years seducing secrets out of the people and making a fortune in the process. At the pinnacle of her career she's presented with a new target Oliver Kirkham a billionaire weapons tycoon whom she figures is another easy mark. But Oliver turns out to be more than she bargained for matching her in and out of the bedroom in every way. Let me start by saying that to me the best way to describe Oliver Kirkham is Tony Stark without the IronMan (superhero) persona. He's smart observant confident sweet and very demanding when he wants to be. He's the dream man that invades every woman's (and some men's) fantasies. When he and Jade are together they ignite a page on fire. I would highly suggest this book to anyone who's looking for a sexy read with heart. You will find yourself falling in love with Jade and Oliver as they grow closer together and your heart will break with Jade as she struggles to keep business and pleasure separate from her emotions. The best way for me to describe B.L. Wilde's Desire is hot Hot and HOT! I look forward to her next installment of this very seductive story.,1,1952-06-24 00:45:50

The extended sequence where Kenji gets the forged passes and has his showdown with the killer feels a bit like beating a level of a video game which I'm sure is at least partly intentional. The heart of 20th Century Boys doesn't lie in moments like these--it's in the moments of everyday heroism and family and friendship--but Urasawa's still pretty good at pulling them off.,4,1976-09-07 07:52:48

161,7762887,golosinor,Ini salah satu buku diskonan Mizan yg gw beli akhir tahun kemaren. Harganya murah belasan ribu aja waktu itu. Siapa sangka isinya membuat gw terkesan. Buku ini merupakan buku kedua dari serinya yg gw ga tertarik untuk mencari judul pertamanya. Sebagai pendahuluan setting cerita ada di tahun 1600an jauh sebelum Restorasi Meiji dimana Jepang mulai membuka hubungan dengan dunia luar. Di sinilah Jack Fletcher seorang anak laki-laki 13 tahun terdampar di Jepang. Kapal yang membawanya berlayar diserang ninja ayahnya terbunuh dan dia jadi satu-satunya yg selamat. Jack kemudian tinggal di bawah perlindungan samurai tangguh Masamoto sebagai anak angkatnya dan turut belajar menjadi samurai di sekolah milik Masamoto. Di buku kedua ini Jack semakin mendalami ilmu samurainya. Ada semacam ujian khusus yg bisa diikuti oleh murid-murid dimana lima orang yang berhasil akan diajari ilmu dengan level yang tinggi. Jack pun ikut mengikuti ujian ini dan satu demi satu melalui berbagai ujian yang mesti dilalui. Sementara dia juga mesti menghadapi halangan dan gangguan dari murid2 lain yang membencinya dan ancaman dari Dokugan Ryu si ninja pembunuh ayahnya yang menginginkan buku catatan penting peninggalan ayahnya. Formula buku ini sejenis dengan Harry Potter. Jack sebagai tokoh utama berperan sebagai murid di sebuah sekolah kemudian dia mulai mengasah skillnya dan melewati semua ujian. Ada teman-teman baik yang mendukungnya seperti Akiko Yamato Saburo Yori. Juga ada murid2 yang memusuhinya karena dia seorang gaijin (orang asing) yaitu Kazuki dan geng Kalajengking yang mengingatkan gw sama Draco Malfoy dan murid2 Slytherin. Kita juga diperkenalkan dengan guru2 yang mengajar di Niten Ichi Ryu di antaranya: Sensei Hosokawa yang mengajarkan ilmu pedang Sensei Kyuzo yang mengajarkan taijutsu (bela diri) Sensei Yosa yang mengajarkan ilmu memanah Sensei Yamada yang mengajarkan ilmu filsafat dan Sensei Kano yang mengajarkan bo (tongkat) dan mata hati Yah memang kesannya mirip Harry Potter ya tapi karakternya Jack lebih bagus di sini ga berandalan kayak Harry. Dan karena dia belajar untuk mengaplikasikan semangat Bushido dalam kehidupannya. Ah iya jadi ketemu dengan istilah ini. Apa itu Bushido? Bushido adalah sikap hidup seorang samurai yang menjunjung tinggi 7 hal: integritas keberanian welas asih hormat kejujuran martabat dan kesetiaan. Rasanya semangat ini juga layak untuk diterapkan oleh siapa saja tanpa peduli suku agama atau negara tertentu. Buku ini juga memberi banyak pengetahuan tentang kebudayaan Jepang di masa itu juga istilah2 yang dirangkum di bagian akhir buku. Informatif. "Tak ada kegagalan kecuali saat tak lagi mencoba" dan banyak quote lainnya yg bisa kita jadikan pelajaran di buku ini. Ohiya satu lagi ilustrasi di buku ini bagus banget dan ada cukup banyak. Ilustratornya adalah Sweta Kartika yg sudah kita kenal juga karyanya di Nusantaranger. Mantap.,3,1979-09-28 17:09:59
162,18338465,philnunn,I am all over the place with this one. All of my GR friends have loved this and I did too. Actually I don't know if I did :( I loved this and then I hated this and then I loved this again and so on... A book that jumbles my thoughts like that definitely deserves five stars though. So here it is 5 STARS for confusing the hell out of emotions! This book couldn't be more aptly titled. Sempre meaning forever ever lasting. The kind of love depicted in this story was just like that - forever going on even after death. Well isn't every romance book like that where you have once in a lifetime love a love that outshines all others? Technically yes. But this book wasn't just a normal romance book with the tried and tested formula of conflict and HEA. In this story every character had to earn their piece of love happiness and redemption. They struggled to find their place in the world and that's what makes it an EPIC read. The love shown here is real because it is full of flaws. The reality the rawness of it made this love story extremely special to me. Carmine and Haven were great together. Their chemistry their romance though at time difficult to read (As in book 2) gave me the butterflies *Sigh* Loved every second of it along with Carmine's foul mouth. I have rarely read a book where even the secondary characters were so well developed (Though I hated that sometimes but at the end it made the story even more interesting) I loved Vincent Corrado Celia Dominic Tess Dia - every single character in this story. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to take a break from the traditional romance and of course if you are a fan of The Godfather Goodfellas Scarface like me - you will LOVE it!,5,1966-06-16 02:55:54

164,18338465,kepcon,2.5 STARS FOR "SEMPRE" BY J.M. DARHOWER But then she happened. The girl who had never been able to call her life her own taught a boy who had the world at his fingertips exactly what it meant to live. He wasn't alone anymore. I think I may have to pick this back up for a re-read one day considering the high rating but I just wasn't feeling it. Carmine and Haven were sweet but I felt that their relationship moved too fast for it to be believable. It seemed like another case of a bad boy who has been hardened by past experiences suddenly breaking down all his walls after a few conversations with a girl he likes. It didn't seem realistic that a guy like Carmine would be discussing things like marriage and children after such a short time (also while he's still in high school!) And while I appreciate the authors intent on making all of her characters flawed in some sort of way Carmine's anger issues really did get on my nerves. Whenever a particular character would even breathe in Haven's direction he'd go crazy and start beating them up. It was weird and disconcerting. But one of the highlights were the supporting characters! Nicholas and his jokes were really cute and I liked Carmine's brother Dominic. Both were incredibly sweet to Haven in their own ways and were able to give the book some small moments of light and humor in an otherwise dark story.,2,1973-06-30 06:45:25

166,17183712,paraskivairina,The story-line...not bad. The terminology for body-parts....oy! I could only laugh because no one seriously refers to their lady-parts as a "Venus mound". Ever. Even if she's 8 years old...this woman is 40!! Bahahahahahahahahahahaha!!! Okay okay for real review coming soon. I am going to now read this from Alexandre's POV. I know a Frenchman is not going to call his parts anything crazy...I hope! :-) **FULL REVIEW** "My dream is to run through lavender fields taste the sun on my skin and be loved forever and ever by this man's side; this man who has seduced me with his quirky sense of humor with sex and now his home-made food and hints of what could be in the future." A girl can dream... A woman needs to make things happen. Pearl Robinson; a woman who is solely focused on her career being that is the only thing she has these days. Middle-aged divorced and with no hope for the future of her love-life but promising as a producer for independent films; it seems Pearl's life is destined to be a lonely one. That is until she accidentally meets the man of her dreams. Wait? He's fifteen years her junior incredibly handsome is part of a huge Social Media enterprise and French! Pearl doesn't know what hits her when this man approaches her in the coffee shop not even an hour after she misses him (for a business meeting) at a local IT conference. Fate has better plans for Pearl and Alexandre than just a business encounter. Alexandre is a different breed of man. He has lived more in his short 25 years than most men and women have life experiences starting at a very young age and hard-times making him into the man he is now. He has an appreciation for women seasoned women; women who have lived...not a girl who does nothing but hang on his every word. Pearl is that woman and what's more she's American. The American woman who will change Alexandre in ways he never realized. Oh what a ride they are in for! "What about French women? Do you see a difference there?"...He ponders this. "Not so much the women themselves but people's attitudes towards them. In America youth is worshipped. In France we love WOMEN. Girls are for boys. Women are for men. At least I speak for myself. I am attracted to women not girls." I won't tell you there isn't a complication in this dynamic between a young man and older woman...but this story just works. Alexandre and Pearl share a connection despite outside influences and obstacles. Aside from the very comical names used for Pearl's "lady-parts" I enjoyed the story. I am looking forward to finding out the rest of the story...Alexandre is a prideful strong Frenchman. Pearl is a beautiful insecure American woman. Wondering if they can really get past all that stands in their way. **3.5 Cougar-Lust Stars**,4,1962-11-21 14:38:52

It was a great book even if it is a cliffhanger. I will be looking for the 2nd book for sure! I thought Ana and Jake were H-O-T! Some of those scenes really did take your breathe away.

169,15710450,blefiz1723,Nobody thought Henri Rousseau could paint. Did that stop him? No he painted on past cruel remarks and vicious critiques and scathing reviews. On and on he paints. On and on he learns new things about painting. Do the critics change their minds? No they continue to laugh at him calling his paintings childish. Rousseau knows the critics are right but he does not care. On and on he goes painting painting painting. It is only at the very end of his life that people change their minds about him and it is only now a hundred years later that his paintings hang in museums all over the world and people revere him as a great artist. An inspiring true story that I found to be perfect for the young readers at my primary school. I can't wait to share this book with them.,2,1983-07-29 08:38:58
170,6531819,nessco,I like Agatha Christie books a lot but this one definitely doesn't top my list of her best stories. I feel like 3 stars is fair. The story follows ten characters all assumed to be murderers who evaded the law. By the end of the story all are dead - including the murderer who hid among them. While not poorly written I question the psychology of the characters a bit. Some of the reactions seemed a little inaccurate to what real people might do. Mostly I'm talking about Vera here. She spent most of the book in a stupid amount of hysterics and was just generally unhelpful. Needless to say I'm a fan of Agatha Christie stories and I usually am able to ferret out the culprit fairly quickly. In this case I think I had it pegged about half way through the book. I think about three or four people had died. It's a logical thing really so no spoilers from me. If you enjoy murder mysteries and the psychology of a group of people suspecting one another of murder this book may be for you. Still it's not her best work in my opinion.,2,1990-11-03 22:13:36

172,16110527,mikeevenson,Last night I finished reading a book called Never by J. Grace Pennington. The writing style of the book just blew me away. I mean I had high expectations for Never to begin with and I was still pleasantly surprised by what I read. The characters were vivid and three-dimensional the storyline was exciting and there were plenty of plot twists along the way to keep you guessing. I'm not going to give anything away but the basic plot goes like this--Travis and Ross Hamilton are brothers who work on a ranch that their father left them when he passed away. Travis is bookish and wants to become a teacher and Ross supports him in that endeavour. Everything goes wrong when a murder is committed in town... and all evidence points to Travis as the killer. He is sentenced to a certain amount of years of labor in the Dead Mines which is basically a prison only much worse. But all is not what it seems in the Mines or in the small town of Spencervale for that matter. I'm not going to tell you anymore because let's face it--if you haven't read this book yet you really should. But enough of my excited ranting; I'll give a more organized and neutral review now for those of you who prefer that to my rambling. The book has pros and cons as well; every book does. I'll give the pros first because there are more of them. ~~ Pros: - The characters are vibrant and believable; much more so than most characters in other books that are being published these days. They have strengths and they have weaknesses. They have fears and they have doubts. Just like everybody does. - The writing style is excellent. There aren't many people who can switch from two different points of view (Ross to Travis in this particular book) without making a mistake or two. But Miss Pennington did it perfectly. She also did a very good job of switching POVs at cliffhangars which made me read faster to get to the other character's POV to see what happened to them. - The ending is unexpected. Now there is information building up to the climax that should tell you how it's going to end but it still surprised me all the same. ~~ Okay now for cons. I only found one or two cons for the book if I'm going to be completely honest. Cons: - There were a few spelling and punctuation mistakes in the book. Not many but there were some there. Nothing too bad; and probably nothing that normal people would have noticed. I however am not normal and nitpick about every little bit of punctuation I come across. ~~ Now see what did I tell you? I've been sitting here nigh on ten minutes and that's the only con I could come up with. I'm not exaggerating either--I'm making the effort to be completely honest in this review so what I say is what I think. So let me see... I don't think there's much more I have to say. This is a book that would have normally taken me only one night to read except I've been insanely busy lately so it took me a few weeks. If you have any questions about the book let me know and I'll answer them! God bless love and peace Theodora,2,1962-01-27 16:18:29

175,28529722,desmetkarin,Lila and Nathan work together in the same office and day after day the attraction grows and so does the chance of get to know each other. They are both damaged they can see straight through the mask they wear to make themselves invisible for Lila or to feel normal for Nathan. They both have scars from their past and problems..they have to work through their fears if they want to be together problem is that Nathan knows about Lila's past but Lila doesn't know about Nathan's past. The more time they spend together the more fears and problems surface...can they be together and help each other or will they break under the pressure? What an emotional journey..I felt for Lila waking up in the hospital yet again and try to decide what to do going back to Nathan and risk tobe hurt again or stay by herself and try to go back to normal even if difficult. They embark on a long journey to try and be together fixing whatever problem they have together and apart to have a go at a normal life be happy together. You can feel their love and the devotion they have for each other you can feel the pain and the guilt you just wish for them to find a way. When everything seem to be really good well that's when tragedy struck..didn't see that coming.. holy hell.. What a roller coaster! Awesome! I loved all the books in the series but this one is the best! I was hooked right from the start. Loved Nathan and his dirty mouth but there was another side of him so sweet and caring! Lila got so strong it was a joy reading about it the way she finally felt free from her past. Did I mention it was hot?!Some scenes will leave you breathless! The second part of the book..well I'm not going to spoil by telling you what happened but I was at the edge of my seat and nearly had a panic attack. The end was just perfect..sad that it's over but I hope KI will give us more!!!!,1,1989-04-02 12:42:05

181,18488643,mraupp,We got this as a review request. I got to be honest... I had No clue and had not heard a thing about this new to me author. Let me tell you what I found... I had a fresh exciting story that kept me glued to the book from beginning to end. Seduction taken to the next level. Get your mark get your goods and get out. Well that is how it's supposed to work out. Jade is the best. She has never ever crossed a line and had anything blurred. Ever! Jade is who she is and sure of herself no apologies needed. She is tough and yet within the pages I became friends with her and even understood her life. I honestly did not think that was possible. I don't want to give anything away.. so I am going to shut up about her. Now let us talk Oliver. He is sweet and kind and sexy.. I mean really sexy! I enjoyed him as a character and felt bad for him on several occasions. I know he has feelings for Jade Jade knows this too. He makes it hard for her and this is a new thing she like I said before does not fail. It is just such a tricky slope and the story behind it. Would he fall for the real Jade? This is the torment and sweet agony of this book.. I was up and down. (I MUST put it out there just like this this author writes fabulous sex. Period! It is not trashy and porn style it is make your toes curl good!) This book was something a bit new for me. The suspense was great. The story did not move at a snail pace but I never felt left behind. Overall minus the cliffhanger that I despise it was a great read. Now let me say I want to know what happens like everyone else they just seriously tick me off - personal opinion but it would never keep me from reading.

183,18777580,thelorena,I equally liked and disliked this book. I liked Sam he was a really interesting character with a lot of depth. I loved the dialogue between Sam and Nina there were times I laughed out loud teared up etc... The first date was brilliant everything about it. What I didn't like was all of the inner monologuing it was a problem for me in Live and even more so with Laugh. It goes on forever and gets boring and tedious for me I ended up skimming through a big part of this book. I will most likely continue with the series because I want to hear Sarah's and PJ's stories but hope Mary Ann Rivers focuses more on the dialogue and less on the monologue. Maybe these stories are meant to be shorter? The Story Guy is still one of my favorite stories.,5,1994-08-22 20:46:52

Myths magic and monsters all exist inside Ryhope wood things that are summoned out of the mind buried legends ingrained in human psyche become terrifyingly real.

186,18338465,clifton233,I presume I misread the blurb because I was really under the impression this was a forbidden love story happening inside the Mafia. It is not. It is a YA cheesy overly long boring and cringeworthy romance happening between characters somewhat related to the Mafia. That is all. I wasn't only bored I was pissed off. Human trafficking of beautiful 17-years-old girls is done for the purpose of sexual slavery and commercial sexual exploitation not for cleaning and cooking for the Mafia leaders. If this wasn't really offensive toward the real modern slavery problem I would have laughed my ass off. Why not keep it real author? Why not make the heroine what she really is in this given circumstances? Because there won't be any real support for the sweet innocent love story the reader's longing for? Yup that's why. So what shall we do in this case? I know! Let's fuck realism let's sugarcoat it and move on.,4,1975-02-06 02:06:15
187,34011714,pallero,I've read all the Uncharted series and it was a delight to go back in time to see how it all started. If you haven't read the Uncharted series then this book is the perfect place to start and if you have read them them you'll love this chunk of Uncharted history following the ancestors as they settled The Land. This would appeal to people who enjoy sweet clean historical Christian adventure romance with a hint of magic. I listened to the audiobook. The narrator was fabulous and well matched to the story.

195,26591894,j1opus,Even though this is not a long book I deliberately took my time when reading it. I am in the midst of a year-long course based on this book and I didn't want to get *too* far ahead. Well the good news is that I read it at a decent pace that allowed me to incorporate where I was in the lessons with where I was in the book. The bad news is that I still finished it way ahead of time! Luckily the lessons come once a day to my e-mail so I'm not stuck referring back to the book all of the time. This is an interesting approach to clearing clutter starting with understanding that clutter is partially mental -- that is to say fear-based. That sense of panic you might feel when you are working on clearing needs to be overcome by basically fooling your amygdala out of worrying about lack. This book contains many useful lessons to help you get there and also to help you recognize when your amygdala kicks in so that you know it's time to quit for the day rather than pushing to the point of panic. I found the book extraordinarily useful and am employing its techniques on an ongoing basis.,5,1967-10-11 19:49:04
196,2093969,matveev74,Coffin Castle the setting of this fairy-tale-like book is not a happy place: it's cold and the thirteen clocks of the book's title have all stopped and the Duke who lives there with his "niece" (she's not really his niece: she's a princess he stole away from her family when she was a baby) is fond of killing people and feeding them to his geese. He relishes telling knights they can marry Princess Saralinda as soon as they finish some impossible task; meanwhile he's biding his time and planning to marry her himself as soon as she turns twenty-one. But you know how stories like this go: there's one prince who's clever enough to do the seemingly-impossible task set for him. Except actually he's not: the prince in this story (who's disguised as a minstrel but not for long) succeeds only because of the help of a kindly double-agent called the Golux and really only because his success has already been foretold. Which makes this kind of a funny book: you know the shape the plot will be because of what kind of story it is and the characters don't particularly feel like real people so much as types so what's left is the way the story's told the rhythm and humor and language of it. In the introduction to this edition Neil Gaiman talks about how he read this book when he was a child and noticed the language how it "slipped into poetry and out of it again in a way that made you want to read it aloud just to see how it sounded" (8). He writes about how Thurber "wrap[s] his story tightly in words while at the same time juggling fabulous words that glitter and gleam tossing them out like a happy madman all the time explaining and revealing and baffling with words" (9). Which is a pretty excellent way of putting it. Thurber plays with rhyme and meter but I think what I liked best was the humor. One character tells the disguised prince that the duke "breaks up minstrels in his soup like crackers" (24). The Golux talking about how his mother was a mediocre witch says that "when she changed her rivals into fish all she ever got was mermaids" (43). And there's a great moment when the Duke says "We all have flaws" followed by "and mine is being wicked" (114).,3,1993-12-10 05:49:31

200,29237614,disinter,*Many thanks to Mira Publishing for an arc of this book for review via Netgally. **Reviewed at Cross My Heart Writings & Reviews. The Graveyard Queen series is one of the eeriest spookiest most ominous series I've ever read. It's also one of the best in this genre. Since finishing The Visitor I've been on pins & needles waiting watching for the next book to become available. Can it possibly live up to the previous books? The answer is an astounding YES! With heart-pounding intensity from cover to cover The Sinner just may be the best one yet. It's been a year since Amelia Gray left Charleston needing time and space to sort out her life and heal her broken heart. In smoldering heat she toils long hours restoring Seven Gates Cemetery in Ascension with her warrior dog always on guard nearby. She passes the nights in a rented house where she wanders aimlessly - always restless always feeling another's presence always trying to forget the man who left her broken. While working in the cemetery she hears a faint distant chanting and senses a sinister presence beckoning her to come. Amelia is compelled to follow the voices helpless to resist the pull at her psyche even as her mind screams at her to run. Lost deep in the woods she makes a horrific discovery - one she will later wish she had never found. An evil presence lurks slivering through shadows taunting Amelia as she realizes she's been summoned to this place at this time for a reason - to unmask a monster. The story that unfolds is one of impending doom pages filled with malicious evil beings dark secret societies murder mutilations rituals mystery. Amelia's search for a killer places her in imminent danger even as she struggles to maintain control of her own mind. At times she doesn't know what's real and what's an hallucination. As a murder investigation begins Amelia meets Detective Lucian Kendrick a handsome man to whom she is attracted but wary. Could this be the man to finally wipe John Devlin out of her mind and heart? The Sinner is steeped in the rich dark history of an old small southern town and cemetery - one where secret symbolic rituals murder and body possessions have occurred. To say it is ominous is a gross understatement. Only a gifted author could pull off such horror in such a beautifully lyrical manner. Through vivid descriptions and lyrical prose Stevens delivers a shocking stunner - an emotional heart-stopping book that will keep you hyperventilating as you read late into the night. Memento Mori Remember to die! The Sinner is an absolutely undeniable Page Burner! It will forever reside on my All Time Favorites shelf! A Must Read!,2,2000-06-16 12:34:55

204,11641698,doregon,Pro: Das Interessante an dem deutschen Cover ist dass man das Gesicht des abgebildeten Madchens nicht sieht - nur die etwas altmodische Kleidung die gut zum Inhalt passt. Weniger zum Inhalt passt der Nagellack denn die Heldin dieses Romans ist ein Madchen dem alles verboten ist was schmuckend ist. Ihr Haar muss sie stets in strenge Zopfe flechten und diese zuruckstecken sie muss lange Kleider und dicke Strumpfhosen tragen damit soviel Haut wie moglich bedeckt ist... Und das ist eigentlich noch das Harmloseste an der Sekte in der sie lebt. Lesen darf sie auch nicht denn Bucher sind Teufelswerk - dass sie heimlich Bucher aus dem Buchereibus ausleiht ist gefahrlich denn sie konnte dafur hart bestraft werden. Sie muss auf dem Feld arbeiten kochen und auf ihre zahlreichen Geschwister aufpassen - ihr Vater hat drei Frauen und daher hat sie 19 Schwestern und Bruder! Aber vor allem soll sie als Madchen den Mannern der Sekte und vor allem den "Aposteln" und dem "Propheten" in Allem untertan sein. Sie darf nicht widersprechen und sie hat kein Recht darauf ihr Leben so zu gestalten wie sie will - nicht einmal den Mann den sie spater heiraten will darf sie sich aussuchen. Sie ist zwar heimlich in den jungen Joshua verliebt aber eigentlich ist sie mit 13 ja auch viel zu jung um an Heiraten zu denken... In der Sekte ist allerdings es nicht ungewohnlich dass Madchen mit 13 heiraten und mit 14 schon Mutter sind. Die Kindersterblichkeit ist hoch denn naturlich mussen die Madchen die Kinder auch zuhause bekommen ohne arztliche Hilfe. Und wenn ein Kind krank ist wird es sogar getotet... Kyra wird eines Tages befohlen zu heiraten - und zwar ihren eigenen Onkel der schon uber 60 Jahre alt ist! Als sie sich das erste Mal in ihrem Leben offen gegen den Willen des Propheten auflehnt nimmt ein Drama seinen Lauf. Es gibt schon einige Bucher die sich mit dem Thema Sekten beschaftigen aber die Autorin verpackt das Thema hier so dass es mir unverbraucht und originell vorkam. Wir bekommen die Geschichte von Kyra erzahlt und dabei ist der Schreibstil eher schlicht aber dennoch eindringlich. Oft hatte ich den Gedanken: Mein Gott das ist ja furchtbar wie kannst du so ruhig daruber sprechen Kyra? Aber das unterstreicht ja nur dass das Leben in der Sekte fur sie das Alltagliche ist dass sie von klein auf damit aufgewachsen ist zu gehorchen und an den Propheten zu glauben egal was er tut. Dass sie das Alles uberhaupt hinterfragt wenn auch nur zogerlich grenzt schon an ein Wunder. Mich hat die Spannung sehr schnell gepackt und dann wollte ich gar nicht mehr aufhoren zu lesen. Ich wollte SO sehr dass sich Kyras Leben zum Besseren verandert denn sie war fur mich so lebensecht und sympathisch dass ich nicht anders konnte als mit ihr mitzufiebern! Auch ihren Vater der ehrlich versucht seinen Frauen und Kindern ein gutes Leben zu bieten ihre leibliche Mutter und ihre Geschwister mochte ich sehr gerne - und den Propheten und ihren Onkel habe ich richtig gehasst weil sie so scheinheilig selbstherrlich und gewalttatig sind. Mein Lieblingscharakter war allerdings der Fahrer des Bucherbusses denn der hat eigentlich keinerlei Grund einem fremden Madchen zu helfen und tut trotzdem sein Bestes. Kyra ist zwar in Joshua verliebt aber eine richtige Liebesgeschichte sollte der Leser dennoch nicht erwarten - diese junge Liebe ist schlichtweg der Ausloser fur die Geschehnisse nicht das Hauptthema. Kontra: Dass die Geschichte oft bedruckend und schwer zu lesen war hat mich nicht gestort denn das Thema ist nun mal ein ernstes und trauriges. Aber ganz kurz vor Schluss passiert noch etwas wobei ich dachte: warum? Warum musste das jetzt noch passieren? Man kann sich sicher daruber streiten ob es notig war oder nicht aber fur mich war es einfach zuviel. Man kann sich auch daruber streiten ob die Mormonen hier akkurat portratiert werden da sie sehr extrem dargestellt werden. ABER - es wird deutlich gesagt dass das Leben in der Sekte unter dem vorherigen Propheten viel besser war und dass erst der jetzige Prophet es zu solchen Extremen getrieben hat. Das heisst es geht hier nicht mehr um eine "typische" Mormonen-Sekte sondern um eine sehr extreme da ein Extremist sozusagen an die Macht gekommen ist. Genauso gibt und gab es im Christentum immer mal wieder extreme Sekten deren Verhalten man nicht als Massstab dafur nehmen sollte wie der typische Christ sich verhalt. Zusammenfassung: Wer sich fur das Thema interessiert wird das Buch sicher interessant und lesenswert finden. Man sollte sich aber im Klaren daruber sein dass es nur am Rande eine Liebesgeschichte ist - und dass die Autorin sich nicht scheut schlimme Dinge geschehen zu lassen wo der Leser sich vielleicht etwas ganz Anderes gewunscht hatte.,4,2007-04-22 02:54:27

208,18488643,cinini2000,I received a copy from the author in exchange for a review. This book was steamy and fast-paced. I liked the idea of the Seductor business and I liked the way Oliver read Jade and sparked up feelings in her. Throughout the book I wondered if Oliver secretly knew of Jade's mission since he read her so well. I was in suspense whether he knew and if he just wanted her to see things in a different way. His release of sensitive information seemed too easy which made me suspect. The author used repeated tags and words (such as smoldered heated center). If she got rid of the tags I think it would have made the writing stronger. It was evident who was speaking and the author used enough details for readers to figure out how something was being done. Overall the author built up the suspense well and I enjoyed the book. I look forward to reading the next series.,5,1964-06-05 07:48:26

214,25930498,goldbond,I haven't chosen the best timing to read the book (for those who may be reading this at some other time: I've read it in Brussels while the city is at terror threat level 4 lockdown whatnot following the Paris terror attacks claiming about 129 lives) but it was totally accidental. Houellebecq may be a good writer but the chosen subject is anything but. And the ideas portrayed in the book whether his own or only his character's are sometimes so stupid it hurts. Well I mean some of it can be blamed on the main character - who I don't know how to better describe than a life-impotent - he lives but just barely the way Houellebecq imagines the average French academic. Reliving the fading morsels of once almost mediocre success within academic circles fading away in self-pity and total lack of will to do whatever with his life. Whether the average French academic is like that or not I have no clue either but hey I didn't write a book about it. But then the world constructed - whether sarcastic or "visionary" as some folks imagine who take him too seriously - is just so bad it bleeds in so many wounds that I would hope is unrealistic but to the most rabid right-wing fear-monger. As such it's difficult to be taken seriously and remains as empty as the main characters final and completely foreseeable submission to this caricature of Islam represented in the book exactly like the worst nightmares of the average clueless anti-Islamist right-wing supporter. In short I don't think the book is Islamophobic (if it was written with that intention then really the author must be more stupid than I give him credit for) or such a great dark satire either. It's dull. It may have been the intent to make it as such (and if so makes Houellebecq a great writer he achieved that totally) but it did not make me any happier reading it.,2,1963-04-24 00:32:46
215,10098773,chrisgbee2,I might actually have given this 4 stars if it hadn't been so long because while it was a rather quick read or maybe easy is a better word it was too long in certain passages in my opinion. However I liked the story and what I especially enjoyed was getting the "evil" point of view the perpetrator. Usually stories about the second world war are told from the perspective of the victims or the heroes and I'm not saying those aren't important I'm just saying this point of view was refreshing. Even if it was fictional. I'm giving it 3.5 stars the last half it gets for the surprise ending! I mean seeing as it is a "flashback" story told after it is all over I of course knew how it would end but the main characters actions at the end still took me by surprise.,2,1955-07-14 17:35:58

Its Dracula himself telling the story of himself and Mina from when he left Transylvania. Most of the book works well although it does drag in places. Its an enjoyable book though its always fun to read a Dracula book and this one is just a little bit different and that makes it more original.

221,3804866,Antonieth15,I learned Hungarian in the 1990s with the previous edition of Routledge's Colloquial Hungarian written by Jerry Payne but having forgot a lot and wanting to brush up I picked up this later incarnation by Carol H. Rounds and Erika Solyom. If you order this be sure to choose an edition that includes both the paperback book and the audio CD. The book introduces you to all the typical aspects of a first-year intensive Hungarian course: all the verb conjugations noun cases and basic vocabulary. Each unit with some aspect of everyday life such as going to a restaurant visiting the doctor renting a flat or visiting one of Budapest's famous baths. The authors introduce a cast of characters that we follow from unit to unit a couple of touching love stories too which helps the reader stay engaged. Hungarian is not an easy language for those who know only English and I don't think I would have learned it had I not spent a great deal of time in Hungary. I think that COLLOQUIAL HUNGARIAN would frustrate any readers trying to learn the language without being able to travel frequently to the place it is spoken. That is namely because the book has too few drills here for Hungarian's dizzingly complex grammar and the learner would need to have daily contact with Hungarian speakers in order to get enough practice to internalize this grammar. However for people who will be based in Hungary for some time or like me have prior experience with the language will find this an enjoyable course. The book lives up to its name (*colloquial* that is spoken Hungarian) much more than its predecessors and the reader will learn many expressions and idioms typical of everyday life that are not typically found in courses based on the literary language.,2,1993-06-13 06:30:42
222,184859,snakanam,This gets a 3.5 out of five stars for me. It was much easier to put down than the other two books in the series. Also it was a mite more predictable. I still enjoyed it. I like June and the quirky characters of the town who rally around their own when the chips are down. I found Jim to be too perfect. I mean seriously. No man is that awesome. I know this because I'm married to a very nearly perfect man but he has a few flaws (which I won't go into here). It robbed some of my enjoyment that Jim never messed up or floundered. Not disappointed that I finished the trilogy. Carr is a great writer of this type of story. And she reminded me why I don't have many romances on my TBR pile. I want more than a predictable HEA in the books I read. The characters need to earn it.,2,2004-12-10 04:18:01
223,18777580,3ziazila,***ARC from NetGalley in Exchange for an honest review*** This started out slow for me but picked up about 1/3 of the way in. Both Sam and Nina started out one-dimensional but grew exponentially for me. This read focused more on Sam and his "issues" which is kind of refreshing though I wouldn't have minded more of an insight into Nina. The different types of love (familial friendships romantic) that permeates this story is uplifting in all its glory - flaws and all. Laugh out loud in plenty of places tear-inducing in some. Good emotional read.,4,2015-07-16 21:50:07

225,19624684,tlgredman954,I must begin with an unusual sort of disclosure: I have at least some stake in the success of this book as it was my first professional indexing job (I don't get royalties; however the better it does the better I look to potential clients). In addition to being the indexer I'm friends with the writer. I've reviewed my friends' books on goodreads before but never as it were when I had "skin in the game" to any degree. Therefore although my enthusiasm for this book is genuine readers will want to consider my possible biases in making their own decisions. In fairnessI will not rate this book in "stars" or any others which I have indexed. One of the benefits of being an indexer however is that I give the books I work on very close readings so I can discuss the book in considerable detail. That's what I prefer to do anyway as those familiar with my reviews will know. This book is as its subtitle states a study of the German regular army and its involvement/complicity with the Nazi genocidal project in the area today called Belarus and at the time known alternately as the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic Generalbezirk Weissruthenien "White Russia" or "Eastern Poland" depending on which authority one referred to. The slipperiness of the region probably explains in part why little scholarship has been done on the occupation of this area which is now no doubt facilitated by Belarus' current status as a sovereign nation. Beorn successfully navigates the difficulty of identifying a "borderlands" region with little national identity or history and the movement of borders is documented by two helpful maps at the beginning of the volume. As a scholarly monograph this work jumps into current Holocaust debate with both feet. Particularly Beorn stakes a claim within the ongoing discussion between "intentionalists" and "functionalists" among Holocaust historians. The "intentionalist" camp which includes Harvard professor Daniel Goldhagen argues that the genocide of the Final Solution was the intended result of Nazi rule from the beginning while "functionalists" which include Christopher Browning from the University of North Carolina argue that the policy developed over time in response to external factors and decisions made by the leadership at various levels. Beorn was Browning's advisee in graduate school (I suppose a further disclaimer that I've had a beer or two with Browning myself is in order) so there's no particular surprise where in this debate he positions himself however he makes every effort to analyze the evidence without preconceptions and is interested in more than defending the functionalist argument. Rather Beorn is more interested in examining the involvement of "ordinary men" as "Hitler's willing executioners" in a project that was far greater than most participants perceived or understood. Since the Second World War Germany as a nation has repeatedly been taken to task for failing to confront the moral crisis of the Holocaust and the responsibility of average Germans for supporting and participating in it. The "Nazis" (by which is often meant only high-ranking strongly ideological Party members) and especially the SS have become in one historian's words "the alibi of a nation." By contrast the Wehrmacht or regular army is supposed to have remained "clean" as they served only as decent soldiers in an indecent war and therefore are not accountable for atrocities or excesses. Beorn blows apart this "myth of the clean Wehrmacht" in the course of this book demonstrating clearly that regular army soldiers assisted Einsatzkommandos by rounding up guarding burying and even shooting Jews and that as the war progressed Wehrmacht units increasingly took on anti-Jewish "actions" on their own initiative. Unsatisfied with monocausal explanations of soldier complicity Beorn combines research into psychological factors (including the so-called "authoritarian personality") organizational culture unit cohesion masculinity and leadership in search of a more nuanced answer. His ultimate explanations may not satisfy all readers but the mass of evidence he presents for the range of choices available to and taken by Wehrmacht soldiers will inform future attempts to understand the horror of genocide. For his case studies Beorn has focused on killings in a few towns (Slonim Novogrudok Krucha and Krupki) and on a conference of leading Wehrmacht and Einsatzgruppen occupiers in the city of Mogilev at which some smaller "actions" also took place. He uses a careful timeline to demonstrate the movement of men and units through four "stages" of complicity - from dutiful but grudging assistance to fully internalized acceptance of the Nazi genocidal project. It is this argument that soldiers did not arrive at the Front fully prepared to begin mass exterminations but had to be moved in that direction by propaganda leadership and circumstances that will be identified as most fully "functionalist" about the overall text and in this sense Beorn makes a compelling case based on his evidence. The question one might ask is how selective he has been in choosing case studies that chronologically confirm his "stages" or more fairly whether these cases which simply happen to be the best documented suggest a progression that could be disproven if a wider range of evidence were available. These questions may well lie at the heart of future "intentionalist" challenges to this work. Nevertheless what emerges is a fascinating story that is bound to have its impact particularly among those wanting to preserve a "myth of the clean Wehrmacht" or a sense that most of the men on the Eastern Front were unaware of genocidal efforts. Beorn has documented the involvement of ordinary occupation troops at every level of the killing process and also as profiteers and exploiters of the situation for sexual benefits. This is not to say however that he demonizes his soldiers or deprives them of agency. Beorn also documents rare instances in which soldiers rescued or assisted Jews or refused outright to participate in murder. In one instance a simple "no" from a commanding officer got an entire Company off the hook without any repercussions or punishment. Indeed what Beorn has found confirms previous findings that individuals who refused participation in the Holocaust were not under immanent threat of death to themselves or their families as has sometimes been claimed but that the Nazi authorities simply found it easier to reassign them rather than confront their refusal. Even within the Hell of the Holocaust individuals did have personal responsibility for their actions it would seem. Unfortunately such refusal was demonstrably too rare and too feeble to end the killing project entirely. For that reason the Holocaust will never make cheerful reading but it remains vital that it and other instances of extreme human inhumanity be studied. Waitman Beorn has applied thoughtful and original analysis to one part of it which hopefully will stir further research that may one day help us to prevent its recurrence.,5,1968-11-06 16:09:11
226,18338465,armanserow,I feel like I was expecting more. I don't know if it was because I've read A LOT of mafia books or because a lot of my friends really loved it but it is a book that covers very important issues,3,2010-01-07 15:33:47
227,18338465,altindish,magine not having any control over your own life. Everything you do is dictated by someone else you are treated as garbage your life is not your own. This is the life that Haven Antonelli grew up with she knew no different. When she is rescued she is introduced into a new life with the DiMarco family. Haven is a beautiful young girl who lives (against her will) to serve those around her all while living in fear. This poor girls is so confused with what her place is in this world. She lives in constant fear even with her rescuers that she will do something wrong. "Never say never. Sometimes we don't realized when we're being disrespectful." ~Dr. DiMarco to Haven As Haven begins to adjust to living with the DiMarcos she finds herself getting along well with Dominic (one of Vincent's sons) however she is nervous around Carmine. Carmine is something else he is a trouble maker - he drinks and does drugs and is...well he's quite the man-whore. "Why drown in love when you can have so much fun swimming in lust?" Yup...that's his attitude and there is plenty of it to go around. He is a misunderstood son of a bitch who doesn't listen to anyone in his life. It's like he is determined to go against the grain in every way possible. Carmine is always on the verge of hulking out over something....I was kept on the edge of my seat just waiting for him to flip out over something. Haven was trying to keep to herself to stay out of trouble. She and Carmine finally start to speak to one another...I really enjoyed the development of this relationship. From the moment they get to know each other I was rooting for them. Carmine had this strange pull to Haven and he didn't know why and he is actually upset when she says to him "I don't hate you. I just....don't understand you." While all of this is going on we are given bits and pieces of who this family really is. Vincent is a doctor however he is always traveling away from his family. There are secrets galore and J.M. Darhower keeps you guessing as to what is going on. Vincent seems to want to keep Carmine and Haven apart telling Carmine to be careful and to not ask questions it's for his own good....blah blah blah typical dad stuff (or is it?). Carmine was really helping Haven she was so sheltered and scared of everything. He takes things slow with her to get her to come out of her shell and relax. Something as simple as going outside of the house to catch fireflies was one of my favorite scenes in the book it meant so much to both of them. "Excitement sparked in her eyes. The sight of it made Carmine's heart skip a beat. It had been years since he felt anything close to that and for a moment he wished he could steal it for himself." For such a young man Carmine is one of the most emotional and sweetest (when he's not angry) guys around. I adored how he was with Haven saying the most beautiful things to her... "Bellisima" he whispered. "You're so fucking beautiful." "You were brought to me for a reason for us to save each other. Because you weren't the only one needing to be saved Haven. I was drowning and you rescued me." Little by little the pieces of the DiMarco and Antonelli family puzzles are put together. I was never sure what to believe I never knew where anything was going. This young couple is put through hell and back yet their love is strong. My heart broke for them... "Just a boy and a girl both of them a bit fucked up but they were just themselves." Love is the strongest bond two people can have...where will love bring them can it make it to the other side of the fucked up hand these two are dealt? This story will make you want to jump right into book #2 Sempre Redemption to find out more about the path that they follow.,5,2005-03-27 07:19:41
228,15799354,mirashi99i,I read this volume out of order (book 3 after book 4) so I knew in part what was happening but now I know the details. Also book 4 makes more sense. Once I got started I found it hard to stop so that I could finish my chores. That is often the case I have found with Moon's writings.

229,7762887,cgrimes,Sabishigaru Sasurai muen Mina hateru Omoishiraseru Taitougomen *** Feeling lonely Wandering alone in strange country helpless Everyone is dead To have a revenge Must become a non-samurai being granted be privilege of wearing a sword Tanka (puisi) oleh Kenji Sekiguchi mengawali kisah lanjutan perjalanan hidup seorang bocah Inggris bernama Jack Fletcher. Setelah satu tahun tinggal di Jepang serta mendalami Jalan Hidup Ksatria kali ini Jack harus memahami Jalan Hidup pedang untuk menjadi Samurai Sejati. Dengan tetap memegang teguh Bushido; Integritas Keberanian Welas Asih Hormat Kejujuran Martabat dan Kesetiaan; Jack ditantang untuk mengikuti ujian Lingkaran Tiga. Lingkaran Tiga bukan merupakan ujian layaknya ujian samurai biasanya. Di sini para samurai diuji tiga kekuatan; tubuh pikiran dan jiwa. Dibanding buku pertamanya buku ini memang kurang greget walau tetap dengan mempertahankan detail bela diri yang akurat serta atmosfer kehidupan para Samurai-nya. Dan buku ini tetap mengajarkan filosofi kehidupan. Sampai-sampai saya berfikir sebenarnya ini buku motivasi dalam bentuk novel atau novel motivasi? Melalui Jack pembaca diajarkan tanpa terkesan mengajari berbagai hal dalam hidup. Seperti: Rasa Takut; "jika seseorang melihat dengan mata hati dan bukan mata di kepala maka tak ada yang perlu ditakutkan". p 123. Rasa takut itu bukan untuk ditakuti tapi dihadapi dengan keteguhan hati dan pikiran rasa takut akan berkurang tidak hilang tapi berkurang. Karena sebenarnya Rasa takut itu sendiri adalah ketakutan. Pikiran kita lah yang mengatur ketakutan itu sendiri dan hanya kita yang bisa menguasai pikiran kita sendiri. Saya jadi teringat momen saat saya mengikuti suatu training dan saya dikondisikan untuk berada dalam ketakutan saya sendiri perlahan saya digiring ke suatu kondisi di mana saya bisa mendengar hati dan pikiran saya. Dengan keteguhan hati saya bisa menghadapi rasa takut itu dan itu pula yang Jack lakukan untuk mengatasi rasa takutnya. Kekuatan Pikiran!!! Yang paling saya ingat dalam kisah Young Samurai: The Way of The Sword ini adalah di mana Jack semakin merasa kalau dia tidak diterima dalam lingkungan sosial warga jepang. Jack melihat semakin banyak perbedaan semakin merasa sendiri semakin merasa tidak dihargai dan semakin merasa dikucilkan. Dan Jack membuktikan kalau Ia punya kekuatan untuk bangkit dan bertahan. "Siapapun bisa menyerah Jack-kun itu adalah hal termudah yang bisa dilakukan di dunia. Tapi untuk tetap bertahan saat orang lain menginginkan kau jatuh itu baru kekuatan sejati" p 175,3,1960-02-09 20:41:30
230,18071375,willardc1,Great deal of potential... **I was given a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.** After reading the synopsis for this book I was very anxious to read it. Ana Sinclair has a huge crush on her mom's fiance Jake. Although he's younger than her mother he's 11 years older than Ana 6'3 and hotter than a June bride!! Her mother is known to jump from relationship to relationship so Ana's not shocked when Stella up and leaves them all without a word. After Stella leaves Ana is left at Jake's house with he and his sixteen year old son Matthew. Jake makes it clear that this is Ana's home and he doesn't want her to go anywhere. Needless to say this leaves the door wide open for Jake and Ana to start one steamy relationship. Aside from the two of them working together he's the Captain for the Fairfax County Police and she's a criminal analyst their main problem is that there is a serial killer on the loose that seems to have an interest in Ana. Can Jake keep her safe until the killer is caught or will he/she get his/her hands on Ana destroying the best relationship that the both of them have ever had? Fair warning this has a cliffhanger!! It started a bit slow for me but I thought that overall the story was a good one. The main character Ana Sinclair was British but almost all of the other characters were American; it seemed to be that many of the characters dialogue leaned toward them all being British. I struggled with this a bit as it just didn't come across well and made some of the characters unbelievable in the things they said and/or did. There were many editing errors (spelling grammar punctuation run on sentences etc.) I can usually overlook editing errors but there were so many that it needs to be mentioned. I thought that Jake and Ana had great chemistry and some of their sex scenes were smoking hot. I would have liked to read more about Jake and Stella's relationship but I have a feeling that we will be hearing more about them in the next book. I was a bit confused with the ending. I understand that it was a cliffhanger but when it switched to a different POV it seemed totally out of place. I wished that Ms. Roberts would have started her next book with this change. I thought that the characters were very likeable and that there was a great deal of potential for a really wonderful read but in my opinion it just wasn't executed properly making it just so so for me. I do have to admit that I'm extremely curious as to what happens next with Jake and Ana as the cliffhanger is a good one!!,2,2009-09-19 12:45:17
231,184859,hest66,Kaum ist die Katze aus dem Sack da muss sich die Landarztin June Hudson auch schon mit den neugierigen und besorgten Bewohner von Grace Valley auseinandersetzen. Dabei meinen es ihre Familie Freunde und Patienten doch alle nur gut. June ist schwanger soll sich schonen und gefalligst den Vater ihres Kindes heiraten. Dabei nimmt man naturlich auch noch den fruheren Ermittler Jim Post genauer unter die Lupe. Zwar denken Jim und June sich eine 'Geschichte' aus doch sein Geheimnis wird von den scharfsinnigen Bewohnern Grace Valleys' schnell aufgedeckt. Allerdings 'spielt' Jane erstmal nicht mit und weicht dem Thema Heirat so gut wie moglich aus. Ausserdem gibt es fur die umtriebige Arztin ja auch genug zu tun. Und im Grace Valley ist auch wieder viel los. So zieht eine neue Familie in den Ort der Pastor Harry scheint personliche Probleme zu haben und plotzlich taucht auch noch jemand aus Myrnas Vergangenheit auf. Ausserdem muss Jane sich mit ihrem neuen Leben zurechtfinden. Immerhin lebt sie jetzt mit Jim zusammen der ihr jedoch keine Last sondern Bereicherung ist. Jim selbst muss sich ebenfalls in der neuen Umgebung zurechtfinden und sich eine Aufgabe suchen. Schliesslich hat er ja seinen Job als Undercoverfahnder an den Nagel gehangt und verfugt nun uber jede Menge Zeit und wenig Bekanntschaften im Grace Valley. Doch durch seine umgangliche Art kommt er den Menschen schnell naher und wird auch rasch ein Mitglied der Gemeinschaft. June selbst wirkt manchmal ein wenig schusselig und naiv. Aber sie ist einfach ein liebenswerter Charakter und jede Frau die schon einmal schwanger war kann ihre gelegentlichen Aussetzer durchaus nachvollziehen. Auch der dritte Teil der Grace Valley Reihe konnte mich uberzeugen. Und wieder mochte ich betonen dass es hier mehr um die Gemeinschaft geht und nicht nur um die Hauptpersonen June und Jim. Ja sicher es wird ihnen sehr viel Platz eingeraumt. Aber die Autorin lasst den Leser auch Anteil an den ganzen Nebenfiguren haben und erzahlt auch ihre Geschichte weiter. Keiner wird stiefmutterlich behandelt und auch wenn der Grundplot der Geschichte vielleicht ein wenig dunn gewesen sein mag so ist die Grace Valley Reihe eine sehr flussig geschriebene und angenehme Unterhaltung gewesen. Selbstverstandlich gibt es fur June und die Bewohner ein Happy End. Dennoch lasst Robyn Carr auch hier wieder viele Sozialprobleme einfliessen und lasst den Leser einen Blick in ein Amerika werfen wo nicht alle reich schon begehrenswert und liebenswert sind. Und auch wenn die Geschichte gut ausgeht hat so mancher Protagonist weiter seine Last zu tragen.,3,1973-05-29 21:59:10
232,18071375,marinache86,Ok so honest review time. I liked the beginning of the book but found once the sex scenes happened the story didn't hold water for me. I felt as if I was reading once sex scene to another with an occasional lead into the actual story thrown in there. I think the story has potential and even though I figured out who the killer was in the very beginning I did like the story as a whole. It was the ending that brought it up from a two star to a four star. If Ms. Roberts had tempered her story a little more with in depth character development and true substance to her storyline as opposed to using the sex scenes to carry the reader through I would have given her a true five stars. As it was the ending pulled her up from two stars to four stars because in the end she began to answer some questions that plagued me through out the book. I realized that she plans a sequel and will hopefully satisfy my unanswered questions then. So for now I will hold out with a four star rating but if she doesn't develop the second book to a higher level and relies on cheap sex to carry me through I will readdress this rating.,3,1985-06-04 18:46:03

235,18338465,ksyushakostko,Rating: 2.5 Stars Sempre is about the love story of two teenagers - Haven and Carmin. Haven has been abused ever since she was a child and will be taken away by Carmin's Father who is a member of the mafia. Thus begin the love story and the recovery of Haven. I am very confused as to how to rate this book. It was far too lengthy and the characters were probably too young for me to indulge in their romance. However I connected far more with Vincent (The main character's father) and I waited impatiently for every chapter based on his side of the story.As expected J.M. Darhower did a nice plot twist by the end and made all dots connect. I feel bad for rating it so low but too much narrating over Haven and Carmin's Romance I needed more plot more action and less "twilight" romance.,5,2000-12-31 06:45:08
236,16110527,tetsukun1st,Um... Wow. I was not expecting that. I was not expecting to spend all day reading this book when I only intended to read a little. I was not expecting to be so gripped by this story that I couldn't stop. I was not expecting to have to rate this five stars. I was not expecting this book to be so well written and put together and full of such strong things. But boy... was it all of that. The mystery was well crafted; I had many suspicions and while some of them were right there were several surprises but they all made sense. I do love a good mystery/whodunnit and this was one. The western aspect was well drawn; I felt entirely immersed in the old west complete with dust and heat. I should also say that I've hardly read any westerns before this. I can probably count them on one hand. But now... I enjoyed this book's western aspect so much that it has made me want to read more of them! The characters were all interesting and there were several I had a hard time figuring out if they were good or not--which again aided the mystery. I loved that. The brothers were marvelously done characters; I really loved their closeness and love and admiration for each other but how they also stood firm on their own. Travis was great and I must say I loved Ross. ;) It's been awhile since I've read a story that did such a good job of characters trying to apply living good moral Christian lives to what was going on around them. I was impressed with how this was done yet in an extremely natural non-preachy way. I recommend it to readers sixteen and up for generally disturbing situations; I found it to be slightly dark but in a good way--a way that makes one think. Well done Miss Pennington. Thanks for the good read. I'll be watching your writing career with interest... ;),2,2016-09-09 01:35:30
237,18338465,kotek1311,I love reading about La Cosa Nostra. The Godfather trilogy is my all time favorite. I like reading articles and watching documentaries revolving that world. Reading this book almost satisfied my craving for it. Almost because I feel like something was missing. Whatever it was it didn't stop me from completely loving this book. Gods. Carmine and Haven. Wow. Their love is so... It's just so... you know?! I'm speechless. I could practically FEEL their love for each other oozing off the pages. No love can be truer than theirs. I mean granted there were some parts that had me questioning the depth of their love. But it was proven. Heck it was proven thoroughly time and time again and also by the end of the book. It had me question myself like how dare I doubt their feelings? Haha. Slow burns are the ones that really stick to me because they're so powerful and intense. And I don't doubt Carmine and Haven's story will forever be engraved in my heart. The author took her time. The pacing was well driven out. The flow was movie-like. The action was AWESOME. (As a mafia-fanatic the scenes and violence were totally realistic. It didn't sugarcoat at all but also wasn't super dramatic enough that it had me cringing.) The dialogues were excellent. (I'm so glad I'm fascinated with The Life that I actually recognize some of their words and most of the rankings.) And the characters -- My the characters were SUPERB. Haven's character development was perfectly done. There were VERY RARE occasions when I thought Carmine's development was all over the place. But by the end of the book the way he faced the consequences and carried the responsibility greatly impressed me. It was far from the wild boy who snuck in the kitchen that first day. The other characters especially the supporting were played out nice. Seriously I LOVED this book. I couldn't put it down. Hands down knees on the ground. Five fucking stars.,1,1954-08-19 02:46:42

I actually had a thought to give it up whenever it went down. too much code for everything that DeMarco want. it's just bleh. I expect too much. actually wanna rated it into 35 but well 4 is ok too I guess. but for now I probably choose not to read the other series because it's just like that. this would be more great if there's more drama and sweetness in their relationship. like drama drama hahah ><,3,1981-04-03 00:11:17

244,27384500,kazakova81,This was an amazing debut by Angela Clarke cleverly utilising the modern day obsession with social media. I loved the acronyms at the start of each chapter some I knew like OMG and BTW and others I had never heard of such as FOMO (fear of missing out). The chapters are quite short and the fast pace of the book means that it falls into the never ending loop of 'just one more chapter'. Freddie is a journalist who thinks in headlines. Everything that happens to her causes a headline to jump into her head especially when she gets caught up in the #Murderer case. As she gets more involved in the investigation the headline thoughts stop as she sheds her journalist skin and becomes a social-media advisor to the police. It was fascinating to see Freddie evolve from a headline grabbing journalist to a compassionate human being. When she meets up with her old friend Nasreen who is now a police officer there is the added intrigue of what happened when they were younger to make them lose touch with each other. It was excellent how the social media theme ran throughout the book as I know all too well about the dangers of Facebook comments being taken the wrong way. I had no idea who the #Murderer was and at one time or another my suspicions fell on almost everybody in the book as I looked at people close to Freddie for any hint or clue that they may have left. It was a complete surprise when the #Murderer was revealed and I applaud Angela Clarke for successfully throwing me off the scent. This is a fast-paced modern social media murder tale that had me on the edge of my seat throughout. An absolutely cracking debut from Angela Clarke and I look forward to reading more from her.

The story seems to have a hard time finding its point. Overall this book really did not capture my imagination as I might have hoped.

253,34007038,littlerosepa,Loved this new series - a breakthrough in a new genre different than the previous works I've read from this author. I was honored to receive an ARC...the story starts out full throttle with a familiar's coven being horribly murdered and she walks in to find the seat of their power devoid of all magic. Queue in a crazy devil dog and the chase is on. The main character Stella barely escapes the hell dog and miraculously magics herself into the middle of a local detective's home (without even consciously trying). I have to say I loved the humor of the detective David Tyler as his normal life is turned upside down with the discovery that magic is real and the things that go bump in the night are not just scary myths. Together Stella and David try to track down this being who murdered London's most powerful trio of witches and Stella will stop at nothing to exact vengeance on behalf of her coven. There's strong character traits and backgrounds and the setting for this magical world is expertly spun leaving the reader wanting to dive in deeper. I hope this new genre continues as it is more along my typical reads; however I will say I have enjoyed everything I have read so far of Stott's - even stories I may not have normally chosen to follow. We have a bright author with an exceptional imagination and gift for storytelling. I do not want to give any additional spoilers away so if you want to read more you'll have to pickup a copy. It's free for Kindle Unlimited so what have you got to lose. I finished the book in two days outside of working (& I put 25 hours in the last two days at work so that pretty much tells you I couldn't put it down until I finished). Can't wait for more in this series and maybe other similar series. The only thing I would like to see a bit more of would be a little love or romance...or even some sexual tension in that club of the succubus. These two had plenty of opportunity throughout their story and maybe there's some to come in the future but I would have loved to see a bit of that. I do tend to favor paranormal romance though so that could just be me! Thanks again for gifting us with your story and for the ARC. Your fellow Super Stranger,5,1993-09-11 16:39:26
254,10018414,sileas,On a whim I decided to read this book that had been sitting on my shelf for years. Figured it was president's day weekend and all why not read a presidential biography. And one that was 100 pages seemed like a good place to start. Obviously that 100 pages means it is really just a brief overview of his life and career rather than any sort of in depth analysis. And while Schaller isn't exactly outright hostile to Reagan and conservatism he is deeply cynical about what he sees as the gap between Reagan's rhetoric and reality. He also never seems to question the effectiveness of government programs. Any cuts are understood to hurt the least needy and any success in the economy is viewed as helping rich fat cats rather than the average person. What Schaller argues is that Reagan made a deep connection with the American people thanks to his talents as an actor and a communicator combined with his optimistic and confident focus on the greatness of America. His focus on a few big things also helped him make that connection. Schaller also notes that Reagan was a great deal more flexible than his conservative supporters recognized or probably would have liked. From taxes and the size of government to foreign policy Reagan compromised when he believed it furthered his long term goals. This short work strikes me as a sort of perfect encapsulation of the mainstream liberal view of Reagan. A man who used his unique skills to great heights but whose underlying beliefs and policies belied his sunny demeanor and rhetoric. If you are looking for a biography that takes Reagan's ideas and policies seriously you will need to look elsewhere. But this one does provide a useful outline of the major issues and events of Reagan's life and gives readers a good place to start.,2,1960-10-24 02:15:25
255,18338465,lordlion20,I don't usually read teenage romance because they are mostly boy-meets-girl-girl-meets-boy-they-fall-into-a-fucking-insta-love-and-go-to-prom things and the insta love was just thrown in to spare the author the pain of having to build a relationship from realistic shits. Sempre has all the mentioned elements but surprisingly it didn't annoy me NOT AT ALL! First of all it was probably because they all had some Italian mafia blood in them. Second the author gave us a nice wise brother (Dominic) who recognized the insta love and tell his brother (Carmine) just that and surprised the hell out of him. This means there wasn't anyone who treated this instalove like it was built in ten years making it easier for me to accept the fact that it wasn't. Third the characters were beautifully flawed. There was none of the shy-but-beautiful-schoolgirl-caught-bad-boy's-attention-for-no-apparent-reason shits. Here we've got a boy who suffered from the death of his mother a former slave girl (Haven) who suffered from physical and emotional scars because of her abusive childhood. He was the one who took her hands and walked her baby step by baby step back to being a real person. She was the one who soothed him and gave him reasons to become a better person. They were a perfect match each relieving the other's pain and encouraged their love to keep hoping. That probably sounds cliche but believe me when I say it was not. It was a beautiful journey. Fourth remember when I said they all had some mafia blood? That detail wasn't just thrown in for fhe sake of being cool. It was basically the spine of the story so you should expect bullets to fly and bodies to be disposed of. But the story wasn't perfect (otherwise it wouldn't have gotten just four stars from me). There were still some little details fhat weren't used to its full extend some quite unbelievable reasons for fights the middle was quite dull compared to the first and last part of the book. And a very cute character I really like took a bullet then was thrown into the lake *sob* Overall Sempre was a quick and nice read. I probably won't read it again but the impression it gave me was quite positive. If anyone ask me for a romance I'll recomend Sempre ;),3,1987-02-16 07:33:09

263,34011714,lyaho,This review is from: Aboard Providence (Audible Audio Edition) Outstanding! I fell in love with The Uncharted Series and this prequel helps fill in the story as to how the land was found and settled. The author does a terrific job world building both on the ship and on land. I especially loved the references to Chincoteague Island as that's a favorite place of mine. The sea journey is realistic I could feel the boat rocking and the trials the explorers endured were full of tension. The characters - especially Marian - are totally fleshed out. I felt like I was on the journey with her rooting for her and Jonah. The narration was tight - a little too tight at times pauses between sections and chapters would have eased transitions - but easy and pleasant to listen to. I recommend this book as well as the series to those looking for something a little different from the standard reading fare out there. It's a clean read - no sex violence or offensive language - for those who prefer their reads flinch-free.,1,1970-04-18 22:30:47

265,18338465,derbendli,What an amazing story. Beautiful characters. I felt everything Darhower I felt everything. Every dream Haven saw but didn't think she could reach. Every jolt of pain Carmine felt. Every moment of agony Vincent had to go through. Every bit of loneliness Nicholas went through. Every bit of acceptance Dominic & Celia felt. Every bit of determination of Maura. Every tear Miranda shed. Every rush of emotion that coursed through Corrado. Every bit of coldness that ran through Carlo & Sal. Everything! The book gave me a whole new perspective to view the world through. To appreciate everything that I take for granted every little thing from sleeping in a warm bed to mingling in the crowd. The deaths were brutal the agony was heart ripping the pain was numbing the story was beautiful and the love was .... everything. My heart went out for Nicholas. He and his little jokes found a special place in my heart. His death was the one which affected me the most. Knock Knock. Who's there? Dead. Dead who? You. Dead you. and then Remy and Dean. God I felt the sadness creeping my heart whenever the pizzeria was mentioned. It was nothing far from reality dozen or more people die everyday like that just like that. As if they mean nothing as if they are nothing. Sigh. Then Vincent he was such a powerful character. I am going to miss him badly. Maura and Miranda shook me from inside. The story is going to stay with me Sempre. Thanks for sharing such a beautiful story with us Darhower thanks for exposing the monsters for letting us know all of this exists and that somewhere some Haven and Abby are wishing and dreaming for things we take for granted everyday for freedom. Thank you.,5,1958-05-19 18:23:59
266,32606520,pyhome,I'm not much into the whole cowboy thing but the blurb introducing this story caught my attention. This was a story that grabs your heart strings and pulls....hard. Chastity didn't think she wanted to deal with the whole idea of falling in love again after all she lost. Kanen thought he was happy with the way his life was going....until he wasn't. Whether you're into cowboys or not this is definitely worth your time if you still believe in a fantastic love story. I voluntarily read and reviewed this Advanced Reader's Copy of this book and I'd read it again down the road since it remains in my reading library. And....that ain't no "bull".,1,1987-02-14 01:43:28

268,17183712,cpuser,Fair warning! I listened to the audiobook and sometimes the narrator can interfere with the reader and writer's connection. But this book is soooo slow to say it is supposed to be an erotic romance. The first chapter focused on rock climbing ROCK Climbing! crazy I keep going back to it trying to listen to for the romance but the first person POV of Pearl Robinson is so aggravating. How can a woman that is successful beautiful and still in great shape be so dang self conscious. I'm just on chapter 5 and I plan on coming back to her to but this woman is aggravating to the power of 10. Also the narrator's slow talk and deliberate French accent makes Alexandre sound like some douche. I'm trying to get through it but I don't think I will and I advise others to stay away from it if you are a true erotic romance fan.,3,1981-05-01 14:12:22

270,23442272,sept77,Quando ho chiuso il libro e ho dato una nuova occhiata alla copertina finalmente ho capito cosa l'Adelphi voleva dirci. L'immagine sul fronte di questo "Forse Esther" e un collage di alcuni fotogrammi di un vecchio film (L'uomo con la macchina da presa 1929 Dziga Vertov) e mostrano in successione alternate fra loro un occhio intento a osservare in varie direzioni e alcune immagini sfocate di luoghi difficilmente riconoscibili. E una bellissima rappresentazione del contenuto di questo libro della Petrowskaja libro che d'altra parte e difficilissimo da riassumere o semplicemente incasellare sotto una sola voce. E un libro autobiografico su questo non ci sono dubbi. La Petrowskaja ricostruisce la storia di tutta la sua famiglia una storia frammentaria e che si snoda non tanto nel tempo quanto toccando buona parte dell'Europa e delle sue culture: fra Polonia Russia Austria in una mescolanza di lingue - tedesco russo polacco ucraino yiddish ebraico - si ripercorre tutta la storia dell'ultimo secolo. Di origini ebraiche la famiglia della Petrowskaja ha infatti vissuto sulla propria pelle tutte le vicende precedenti e successive alla seconda guerra mondiale: fra nonni dispersi parenti deportati e internati prozii implicati in vicende politiche dinastie di maestri impegnati nell'insegnamento ai sordomuti nonne di cui neanche ci si ricorda piu il nome (la "forse Esther" del titolo) l'albero genealogico che si va a comporre e quanto di piu complesso e sorprendente ci potremmo immaginare. Qui entra pero in gioco lo stile di scrittura della Petrowskaja. Uno scrittore "canonico" avrebbe iniziato a raccontare la storia dall'inizio lei invece sceglie una strada decisamente piu tortuosa. Nelle pagine di questo libro si seguono le sue ricerche si scoprono informazioni man mano che lei stessa le ha acquisite capita di soffermarsi su parenti scoperti solamente per caso si seguono i suoi continui viaggi sui luoghi dove qualcuno della famiglia e vissuto o e stato costretto a vivere (da Kiev a Mosca da Varsavia a Berlino ma anche nei ghetti e nei lager). Lo stile della Petrowskaja non e mai una cronaca diretta: non semplifica la vita al lettore preferisce perdersi nei suoi pensieri e raccontargli le cose un po' come vengono. Lo definirei un libro di ricordi piuttosto che un'autobiografia un libro di ricordi confusi. E se entrare in sintonia con il suo modo di raccontare all'inizio e tutt'altro che immediato siamo ripagati da un racconto sentito profondo che vuole metterci a parte di tutte le vicende successe alla sua famiglia ed e anche un modo per farci sentire quanto la sua ricerca sia stata impegnativa un'idea fissa per diversi anni ("da tempo oramai la mia ricerca era diventata un'ossessione"). E tornando alla copertina quell'immagine scelta dalla Adelphi rappresenta benissimo il modo di raccontare della Petrowskaja: un continuo guardarsi attorno a tratti quasi frenetico tanto da non riuscire a mettere neppure a fuoco esattamente cosa sta cercando ne cosa voglia raccontarci. A libro finito e infatti difficile dire di aver seguito completamente le vicende: i nomi dei parenti si mescolano fra loro le vicende si confondono diventa difficile separare i "forse" dagli "e andata proprio cosi". Rimane solo la sensazione di aver capito perche la Petrowskaja si e voluta impegnare in questa ricerca e viene quindi naturale dirsi che non e poi tanto importante aver capito il suo albero genealogico quanto averla ascoltata raccontare la sua storia. Quando Lida la sorella maggiore di mia madre mori capii che cosa significa la parola Storia. Il mio desiderio di sapere era maturo e io ero pronta ad affrontare i mulini a vento del ricordo ma poi lei e morta. Ero li con il fiato sospeso sul punto di domandare e cosi sono rimasta e si fosse trattato di un fumetto la mia nuvoletta sarebbe stata vuota. La Storia comincia quando all'improvviso non ci sono piu persone alle quali poter domandare ma solo fonti. Io non avevo piu nessuno cui chiedere nessuno che ricordasse ancora quei tempi. Restavano brandelli di ricordi appunti e documenti tutti da verificare e in lontani archivi. Anziche porre a tempo debito le mie domande mi ero mezzo soffocata con la parola Storia. Ero forse adulta adesso perche Lida era morta? Mi sentivo in balia della Storia.,2,2009-10-13 22:36:31
271,10803536,katenamuse,When I entered the giveaway drawing for this book I didn't realize until I actually received it that it was co-written by my favorite TV-meteorologist Bill Evans. His weather expertise is really shown in this book but it's explained in a way that even casual weather report viewers like my self can understand what's going on! (WARNING: The following paragraph may be seen as spoilers by some.) Tess Beauchamp is a weather researcher and extremely specialized atmospheric expert who is asked to replace Greg Simpson who once supervised her with very negative results as the head of the TESLA installation in Antarctica. Owned by Flint Agrochemical a corporation that supplies much of the world's food TESLA's main mission is to provide Flint's crops with the weather they need to grow prosperously. When Tess arrives however she discovers three surprises: first that TESLA is also dedicated to destroying the competition whether it's by sending droughts to the fields of their competitors or tornadoes to small farmers that refuse to sell their property; second that TESLA has a second client the Pentagon; and third that Greg still holding a grudge from his first encounter with Tess is much more emotionally attached to his pet project than anyone realizes. As Greg's loose grip on reality results in increasingly catastrophic weather events Tess and the TESLA staff must race to save the world as they know it from being destroyed. In "Dry Ice" Bill Evans and Marianna Jameson have created a story that draws you in from the very beginning. They set scenes that You can see before your own eyes and paint such a full picture characters in only a few paragraphs that you lament their violent deaths just a page or two later. This book is hard to put down with fast-paced action that keeps you reading to find out what happens next! I received this book for free as a First Reads giveaway but I definitely plan on going back and reading Bill Evan's first book and I'd read anything else I can find by this wonderful writing pair!,2,1966-11-04 15:24:52

273,2093969,jelannayatebe,Written nearly sixty years ago James Thurber's children's book The 13 Clocks seems remarkably modern even by today's standards. It has a dark edge (Hence the Niel Gaiman introduction to the NYRB edition) that reminds one of both Roald Dahl and Lemony Snicket - and like both these authors Thurber does not dumb down his prose. There is a kind of sophisticated sub-text running below the tale making it the kind of book even more likely to appeal to adults than kids. Every great fairy-tale needs a villain and The Thirteen Clocks boasts one of the most dastardly- the evil Cold Duke. As a youngster he spent so much time place-kicking pups and punting kittens that his legs grew to different lengths. His heart is so cold that he himself has grown icy and he has taken to permanently wearing jewel-encrusted gloves. "His nights were spent in evil dreams and his days were given to wicked schemes" and the wicked schemes the Duke most favours are those that foil any attempts a foolish suitor might make to marry his niece the beautiful Saralinda. The Duke delights in setting impossible tasks for such suitors and when the suitor inevitably fails...well let's just say the Duke's geese have a protein rich diet. As the story progresses we find that the Duke has an even darker past that at first revealed and yet their is a certain charm to his unrepentantly self-aware brand of evil. That a strange handsome young man should show up to try to win the hand of Saralinda is not uncommon- but there seems to be something...princely?...about the poor minstrel who has the gall to sing songs insulting to the Duke. Could this be the suitor who will finally succeed where so many have failed? It is a tale populated with fantastic characters and creatures. Stories within stories parables tales both tall and somehow true. The brilliantly whimsical word-play used in this short tale rivals that found in The Phantom Tollbooth or Haroun and the Sea of Stories. In short it is a book that appeals not only to children but to adults who seek the fantastically original in style and story.,3,1975-11-19 10:50:10
274,18777580,martcopy,This was such a sweet emotional story. This is the second book in the Burnside Series and it follows Sam Burnside's love story. Despite being book two in the series you don't have to read book one to follow this story. Sam Burnside is a doctor he is a really sweet and extremely over protective guy when it comes to the people he loves. Nina Paz is widow and a farmer she suffered so much after her husband died that she basically shut the world out. When Sam and Nina meet sparks fly immediately; Sam is quick to profess his love but Nina is afraid and more guarded so she keeps pushing Sam away. For most of the book I kinda hated Nina Sam was such a great guy even when he was referring to himself as an asshole he was still trying so hard. Definitely worth reading the writing is so emotional and the story is so realistic they don't have any far fetched careers no one is a billionaire or anything; all the characters are down to earth regular people and that is what makes the story more enjoyable.

275,18777580,holita,Sorry if this review is not so good the first one was better but I lost it. =/ 5 laughing stars I love Mary Ann Rivers books. They always make me feel so much and all of it is good. In Laugh she remind me that we can laugh and be happy even if things in our lives is not that good. We can find happiness in our families friends and in the silly little things we do everyday. We met Sam Burnside in Live and in that book he was a control freak always yelling and fighting with his siblings and in Laugh we have the same Sam but we got to know why he does what he does. Sam has ADHD and struggles very much trying to put in order everything that is always racing through his mind. He feels like he never does anything good enough and because of that he tries so hard so hard that in the end he messes everything up poor thing. I really felt for him what people and sometimes even his siblings doesn't see is that everything he does is out of love. But there is someone who sees him as he is. Nina Paz a farmer who lost so much in life but found happiness again through her friends and work. When they're together is like they can put all their problems behind and just be. They're so funny and together they find that love can be very simple but sometimes we are so afraid so full of grief we MAKE things difficult. Their journey is beautiful and a joy to see them get past their fears. There are lots of goodness in this book: their first date is priceless hilarious; PJ dressing Sam up for his date is very funny too; Sam and Mike friendship and interactions are great man bonding at its best. Actually the support characters are awesome we have Sam's brother and sisters his friends; Nina's friends especially Tay. I could go on and on about this book. Very good and highly recommended.

277,25976137,ogdenp,The Mark and the Void is a novel about a banker getting a novelist to write a novel about his life and that story becomes the novel The Mark and the Void. Though the above summary sounds absurd and incomprehensible be assured that Paul Murray's new novel The Mark and the Void is not It is a rare book. One that manages to satire the world of high finance banking while simultaneously make some deep and intriguing claims about the role of art and literature in the daily lives of everyday people. The novelist Paul Murray manages to do all this without sentimentalizing his characters nor lapsing into polemics. In his previous novel Skippy Dies Murray showed his ability to deftly write about sensitive subjects such as child abuse alongside couples conflicts and domestic problems while at the same time writing comedic scenes that made me giggle insanely in public. This novel is set in Dublin not long after the collapse of the Irish boom economy referred to as the Celtic Tiger. The main protagonist Claude is a French investment banker and speculator who takes a job at a multinational investment firm that managed to survive the crash and is actually profiting from the government 'rescue' of the banks. Claude is a person without an interior who likes the abstractness of his job who prefers 80 hour work weeks and to avoid meaningful contact with others except for "weekend romances between 5pm on Friday and Monday at 7am." Claude's life though changes when he is contacted by the novelist Paul Murray(yes he embraces the whole metanarrative/postmodernist approach and then proceeds to choke the living shit out of it) who says he is writing a novel about the "human face of bankers" and wants to study Paul's daily routine. Due to his coworkers promptings Claude agrees to the proposition and becomes involved with Paul's life and the world of fiction and publishing. What follows are some picaresque adventures in which the two mismatched temperaments learn a great deal from each other about art life and banking. The novel excels as satire because the author has done his homework. It would have been an easier route to have just done character studies of the horrible personalities involved in banking and let that speak towards the dehumanizing effects of what modern casino capitalism does. He does do this and we see that most of the high finance people involved are not so much banally evil as Hannah Arendt famously described Adolf Eichmann but rather incurably adolescent. They spend their days destroying whole cities and peoples and economies for profit without a hint of shame or even guilt rampage through the economic system like a herd of Godzillas on meth and high fiving each other as they do so. But Murray goes in depth as to how a modern investment firm works what it actually does during the day and how the people who work their do their jobs. In fact he does this so well and understands it so well he often times just steps out of the way and lets the absurdities and contradictions in the casino capitalist system speak for itself: "We've had a technology crash a housing crash not to mention a financial crash that nearly sent the world back to the Stone Age. Oil gold collapsing. Eurpoe coming apart even the Swiss franc can't be trusted. Where does the smart man invest in investment doesn't work anymore? What's the one reliable area of growth in the 21st century?' 'Technology?' says Kevin. 'Inequality' I say. 'Bingo' Howie wags his cigar at me. 'You know what the Gini coefficient is Junior?' 'Its ah what they use to measure the gap' Kevin stammers. 'Between rich and poor.' 'Right. And its ging through the roof...a tiny number of very rich people including fat-cat bankers like us are sucking up a bigger and bigger percentage of the wealth. And that gap will continue to widen because with all our extra capital we go and buy up all the assets so that for instance when Chang working down there in Spar needs somewhere to live he has to rent his house from me meaning that I'm getting most of his wages too.' He pauses puffs on his cigar; the coal glows brazier-bright everything around it seeming to grow commensurably darker. ...."there's not much you can sell to a world full of poor people Crazy. So instead you make them the product...these millions of Americans who were shit poor but who nobody trusted enough to loan money to. They saw that if they could get these deadbeats into the debt market-well its like the oil under Alaska right? Billions and billions of dollars just waiting to be release..." But as a modern novelist Murray also has a lot to say about art and literature. Claude realizes he is 'a person without a story' and much of the novel sees him trying to get Paul to help him effectively craft his own life story. Something meaningful. And there follow picaresque adventures of the two of them involving literary critics who double as strippers eastern European pimps talk show hosts Greek refugees French Existential philosophers and an island full of natives in the south pacific. He satirizes writers and critics alike and we see that they are every bit as self involved as the investment bankers and no one has a real moral authority in the book. There are some funny exchanges over the nature of lit and genre. For example this one that takes a look at the conventions of romance novels: "Ish makes an oar of her finger scoops it along the inner rim of her cocktail glass which is frosted with cream. "No because I just thought I mean in a book when the guy's in love with someone out of his league or whatever and it doesn't work out what often happens is he realizes he's had feelings for someone else all along.' 'Someone else?' 'Yeah except you know he only realizes now?' I give this some thought. 'Does this happen in books?' 'It does in the ones I read' she says a little defensively. 'To me the scenario does not sound plausible. How does he only realize now? Love is not like an illness gestating in your body before you begin to feel sick. In my experience if you are in love you know it straight away.' 'Yeah that's true I suppose' Ish says. 'Attraction is a conscious thing. If you're attracted to somebody you are aware of it.' 'Right fair point' she says. 'If you have not thought about this person in that way before its because you are not attracted-' 'Might just pop up to the bar'Ish says jumping to her feet. 'You want anything?" The book goes on to search for the 'story' of each of the characters as they try to create lives. Murray does an excellent job of moving between the high finance world with its glitter and the homeless and economically destroyed poor of Dublin. The book is much a way of searching for connection for understanding. In a sense not just novelists need to seek for their stories it is shown to be revealed the job of everyone.,1,1976-08-03 05:34:33
278,18338465,amorsito04,Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || Pinterest dYZf Read for the Unapologetic Romance Readers Halloween 2017 Reading Challenge for the category of: a romance novel with blood on the cover dYZf Good books make you ask questions - but sometimes bad books make you ask questions too. Questions like "Why is this book so long?" "How did this even get published?" And most pressingly "What is it about this book that people actually like?" I read SEMPRE for our book of the month over at URR and am only just now finishing it because of how awful it was. It wasn't even spectacularly awful - just dismally so. Everything about this book dragged. Most of those 500 pages? They're all padding. The story without all that fluff is pretty simple. Haven is a teenage slave. Carmine's father buys her. He falls in love with his slave and she falls in love with him and it's all hearts and cuddles and tender moments - until the mafia steps in and says "Hell no." I hate to say it but I was on the mafia's side in this one. I was like "Hell no" too.A Here's my biggest issue. SEMPRE reads like the author wanted to write fanfic of Goodfellas Godfather and Sopranos but she also really wanted to write a disgustingly fluffy book like Stephanie Perkins but she also wanted to write a really edgy new adult book with SEX but she also really wanted her hero to be a Nice Guy but she also really wanted her heroine to be pure and virtuous. Even though you know she grew up in a world of sex trafficking. So what we have is a PG-13 mafia/human trafficking book where most of the book takes place in high school and there's a few random scenes that seem to be heavily inspired by the three mafia books I mentioned all written from Carmine's father's POV. Haven is a slave whose mother is basically a sex slave but Haven herself is used for cooking and cleaning and that's it. She's innocent about everything and even asks in all seriousness whether there are colleges in California. WHAT. I mean there's sheltered and then there's how-the-hell-did-you-not-know-that. Carmine is everything I hate in a hero. He swears a lot and punches people out to show how tough he is and Darhower desperately tries to make him the good guy by punching out these people on Haven's behalf and having all these forced intimate moments with her. Forced in the technical sense that is: not the rapey sense. And Haven is so naive that she makes me sick. You can tell that she's just supposed to be so adorable because she nibbles at food nuzzles at people peers up at people and chases fireflies while the adoring Carmine just sits there and smiles in vacant admiration because that's what people do when they watch cat videos and Haven is basically supposed to be the human equivalent of a cat video - only for some reason it's not cute when a person does it just disturbing. I'm still blown away by how boring and terrible this was and that it has a 4.2 average rating on Goodreads (did we read different books?). SEMPRE took a dar topic and tried to make it a cute love story. The result is a book that comes across as both tone deaf and ridiculous. 1 star,1,2000-01-04 22:27:10
279,16130164,gsjonesinc,I fell in love with Tallis in Caged Warrior. For him to get his own story I am overjoyed. A berserker and a telepath though? I expected it to be a trite and common ideal in paranormal romance. So I was pleasantly surprised (like always with Ms Piper thank you very much) :)The hero and heroine have a lust/dislike relationship and it keeps you coming back for more! Tallis is witty and comical and the sex?whoowee! Talk about HOTT. That's all I ask for in my reads! It keeps you on the edge of your seat and engaged from cover to cover. Superbly written without over inundating you with trivial descriptions. Absolutely love Pipers writing! I am currently reading this and just can't seem to put my kindle down lol!,1,1984-05-30 10:42:51
280,32606520,jshojvg,Kanen and Charity have both had painful pasts and lasting scars. They are distrustful of others but feel a strong connection. They have to work thru the pain and take a big risk for a chance at love. I really enjoyed the story and the characters. They both have had so much pain and reason to distrust others. Their love is very healing. You can feel the connection between them right away. I am voluntarily reviewing a copy I received.,2,1954-08-30 16:38:11
281,14870610,terlen64,A Native American versus the wilderness of the Soviet Union. Central Russia. 1986. An Air Force pilot Major Joe Mack shot down over the Bering Sea escapes from a Soviet prison camp. His plan: Travel east across the frozen wasteland of Siberia and make it back to America by crossing the Bering Sea to Alaska. His advantage: Mack's Sioux heritage of wilderness survival and hunting. His opponent: a Soviet Army colonel and a native Siberian tracker who will stop at nothing to recapture him. Original. I cannot put it any better than that. Years ago actor Russell Means ("Last of The Mohicans") complained that Hollywood never made any good films about Native Americans even "Dances With Wolves" did not satisfy him because "it was about a white guy!" While Mr. Means has since passed away I like to think he would have loved this story. A story about a modern man who reverts to his Native American upbringing to survive against the Soviet military and the deadly power of nature. This is the second time I have been astounded by a non-western L'Amour novel. Will there be a third?! Pros: A realistic story about escape and evasion from a POW perspective Several well developed villains A sympathetic respectable view of Soviet citizens (keep in mind this was written in the 80's) A Native American hero who lives by a warrior code in a strange land Excellent narration by Academy Award nominated actor David Strathairn Cons: If you want romance or humor look elsewhere If you want a "western" feel to the book read something else Sometimes it gets a little confusing with the various Russian characters but it won't ruin the story,2,1999-03-25 03:08:55

284,11455127,bondik1994,I think this book is a classic of what can go wrong with menage when the people involved don't think things through. Ethan knows his relationship has hit a rough patch with Mira mostly due to his actions of ignoring. During a weekend away he decides to surprise her with a three way her secret fantasy with her old boyfriend and his friend. Here is where the problem starts. I can see Ethan wanting to give Mira this experience but allowing an ex to be the third is just asking for problems. And of course those issues come up. Rogan realizes that this new uninhibited side of Mira is just the woman that is perfect for him and regrets letting her go. Mira realizes that she still wants Rogan. And Ethan realizes that he didn't think this whole situation through as twinges of jealousy keep popping up. At times I found myself wanting to slap each of them for their actions and for none of them thinking through the repercussions. I hated the position that Rogan put Mira in at one point and hated Mira for going along with it. I thought the last scene was one that needed to happen. There needed to be a confrontation between all of them and I think the ending is what worked for all of them. Even with all the interpersonal drama this book was full of hot sex that will leave you fanning yourself. I look forward to reading more in this series.,3,2005-10-15 04:16:21
285,10018414,lcerchie,A Short Biography Of Ronald Reagan After reading Thomas Mallon's largely disappointing novel "Finale" about Ronald Reagan I was moved to revisit our fortieth president through non-fiction. I also became interested in thinking more about Reagan through reflection on our current presidential contest and on what if anything his life and presidency might teach us. I also wanted something brief and I found Michael Schaller's 2010 biography "Ronald Reagan" to help satisfy my interest. Schaller Regents Professor of History at the University of Arizona is a scholar of 20th Century American history and foreign policy. Everyone who knew or studied Reagan observed how difficult he was to get to know. His exterior friendliness concealed interior reserve which his friends took for depth and his enemies for vacuity. The same kinds of widely divergent views might be applied to Reagan's presidency. Schaller's book offers a clearly-written concise picture of Reagan which recognizes the ambiguities in his life and presidency and perhaps wisely does not attempt to probe deeply below the surface. The book presents an integrated portrait of Reagan by tying in characteristics from his early years in Illinois and his years as an actor in Hollywood with the traits he displayed as politician and president. He finds Reagan showed a strong degree of likeability together with a gift for cutting to the heart of complex issues in few words. Reagan also realized the value to leadership of inspiration and ideals while sometimes micro-management and factual analysis to subordinates. He tended to portray issues simply and positively. Schaller also finds a tendency to play loosely with facts and a tendency to passivity and to blame others both in Reagan's private and public life. The book shows well that Reagan was not the buffoon or extremist portrayed by his enemies but was instead an informed politician with a strong sense of what he was about. In considering Reagan's presidency Schaller finds it strong on ideals and inspiration but questionable in the way of specific accomplishment. He points to how Reagan raised the national debt modestly improved the economy and created through deregulation the savings and loan crisis among other issues in his domestic policy. He argues that Reagan's War on Drugs was a failure and that Reagan failed to stem what he viewed as the unfortunate tide in the nature of sexual mores. In foreign policy Schaller discusses the Iran Contra scandal which led to the possibility of impeachment and the eventual rapprochement between Reagan and Gorbachev which signaled the break-up of the USSR and the end of the Cold War. Questions remain as Schaller notes about the extent to which Reagan's policies led to the thaw or contributed to the USSR's demise. There is a large literature about the 1980s and about Reagan's presidency. Schaller's book offers a good annotated bibliography of both primary and secondary sources for readers wanting different perspectives or fuller accounts. Subsequent to this book in 2016 Jacob Weisberg's short biography has been published as part of the American Presidents series. Ronald Reagan: The American Presidents Series: The 40th President 1981-1989 which has received several perceptive reviews on Amazon. While recognizing Reagan's strengths Weisburg's book also takes a critical approach. Schaller offers a fair-minded but skeptical assessment of Reagan. He does not share Reagan's conservatism but he makes an attempt to understand and appreciate what Reagan did. I don't think Schaller values as highly as it deserves the inspirational aspects of Reagan's leadership in encouraging Americans to approach issues in a positive hopeful way with the view that the United States could remain a force for good in the world. Schaller discusses how after Reagan's presidency in 1994 he wrote a letter to the American people indicating that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Although Reagan wrote that he was passing into the "sunset of my life" he observed that there would always be a "bright dawn ahead" for America. It is this simple hope and vision that stays with me as I think about Ronald Reagan. Robin Friedman,2,1959-10-26 07:14:56
286,23626289,aheiro's,Was fur ein Buch! Ich bin begeistert! :D INHALT Nach den Geschehnissen aus den ersten beiden Buchern taucht im 3. Band ein alter Bekannter wieder auf: Blake. Was will er? Kann man ihm wirklich trauen? Daemon und Katy sehen sich einer riesigen Bedrohung entgegen und ihrer aller Leben sind bedroht. Noch dazu ist Dee absolut nicht gut auf Katy zu sprechen wegen dem was zuvor geschehen war. Und auch die "normale" Zeit mit Daemon ist ausserst rar... MEINUNG Leider musste ich das lesen aus zeitlichen Grunden zwischendurch langer unterbrechen. Aber jetzt habe ich den Band durch und ich will direkt zum nachsten greifen. Aber was heisst "will"! Ich MUSS wissen wie es weitergeht! So ein gigantischer Cliffhanger ist megafies und ich bin sooo froh dass ich den 4. Teil direkt schon ausgeliehen habe! Die Geschichte ist gewohnt spannend und der Leser begleitet die Lux und Katy bei all den Zweifeln uber Freund und Feind. Daneben ist die Beziehung zwischen Daemon und Katy ein wichtiger Part des Romans und es macht einfach nur Spass all die Entwicklungen zu verfolgen. Ich habe sehr mit den Figuren gelitten und mich ebenso mit ihnen gefreut. Kurzum: Das Buch ist definitiv 5 Sterne wert und sollte UNBEDINGT gelesen werden! :D Einfach nur TOP! :D,2,1963-06-12 07:34:55

In this cute story Bill the wizard visits the zoo after all the people have left and grants the wishes of the animals. When daylight returns the animals return to their normal selves. The first thing I thought about after reading this book was that this would make a great read to use for creative writing. Having students write about other things the wizard could do to the animals. Another writing idea that popped into my head was what if the sun rose before the wizard could turn them back. Great mentor text for creative writing possibilities for children.,4,1967-11-17 16:45:31

289,6792037,bleevinue,Sotahevonen on vinkea romaani kahdesta neuvostoliittolaisesta desantista jotka joutuvat Suomeen - toinen maarattyna toinen vahingossa. Kirjan loppupuolella joukkoon liittyy myos hevonen "siviilinimeltaan Heikki". Joukkion retki Suomi-neidon uumalla on perin vaiheikas: kaikenlaista sattuu mutta kovin montaa ei pyrita satuttamaan. Arto Paasilinna ei kuvaa sota-ajan meininkia yhta (tikahtumiseen saakka naurattavan) humoristisesti kuin Veijo Meri mutta desanttien nakokulmasta kertominen riittaa etaannyttamisen keinoksi. Suomalaisesta lukijasta on hauskaa kun suomalaiset henkilot ovat niiiiin suomalaisia. Esimerkiksi hotellin johtaja kailottaa hotellin ensiluokkaisuudesta myos pyssylla uhattaessa. Kuten humoristisessa sotakirjallisuudessa yleensa Sotahevosessakin monenmoiset poikkeamat tavallisuudesta perustellaan sotatilalla. Poikkeusolosuhteissa elaminen antaa oikeuden tehda kaikenlaista kummallista. Luovuus kukkii ja ohjat saa ottaa omiin kasiin kunhan noudattaa ylempaa tulevia kaskyja ja alistuu kohtaloonsa. Kohtalon arvaamattomuuden teemasta jai erityisesti mieleen tama katkelma: Hanella oli kadessaan aisakello jonka han oli irrottanut valjaista; desanttien matkoilla ei aisakellon helina kuulu asiaan. Savolenko heitti tiu'un metsaan se helskyi mennessaan kunnes putosi pehmeaan lumeen. Savolenko ajatteli etta kyllapa sodassa tuhoutuu kummallista omaisuutta niin kuin juuri nyt tama kellokin: koskaan se ei iloisesti kilkattaisi aisassa vaan maatuisi metsan sammaleisiin makaisi iati aanettomana Kainuun korvessa vain sen takia etta se oli sotahevosen aisaan kerran ripustettu.,5,1962-12-20 02:08:47

His true character. I have to admit in the beginning the book was ao repetitive I found myelf skipping. Initially I was going to give this a 3 star review but once I got past all the repetition from the first two books the storyline was perfect and the ending was more than I can ask for.

And it true that there's a intensity to it but there's also a lot of fun moments in between all the bad that makes this story a lot lighter. I like that the author doesn't get in too much detail about the bad things. I mean it's already bad enough knowing it happens I really don't need the whole scene stuck in my brain too.

293,18338465,golantarm,I really struggled with this as I kept reading it hoping it would get better but it kept disappointing me. DNF'd at 60% for following reasons: 1 - this is a dark read and not what I would class as romance - more of a confusing Mafia story with a smidge of insta-love between two naive teenagers 2 - I wasn't expecting this to be a 'love' story between teenagers...the blurb led me to believe the H and h would at least be in their twenties 3 - the story got confusing because I kept feeling I was missing something - all the characters appeared to know things that was not made clear to the reader! 4 - I didn't feel anything good for any of the characters - none of them did anything to show good character to me (e.g. h has opportunity to escape but doesn't H blows hot and cold with h and h just accepts it H's father is a douche) 5 - the story wasn't going anywhere!!!!!,5,2009-12-27 23:44:46

295,184859,gulnur83kg,Why I Read This Book: I read this book for two reasons first I am a Robyn Carr fan and have read this entire series and second I read this with some of the Novel Ladies. What I liked: I liked reading about the small town and all the residents. I also enjoyed how the people in the book felt real this could be a town you live in or have traveled thru. What I didn't Liked: The ending of the book because I felt like I was moving away from my friends and would never see them again. I wanted this book/series to go on just a little longer. I would have liked to have at least one more book in this series. Overall Impression: I was so happy that Jim was there to stay. I liked how he gave June her time she needed to get used to him being around even though they were going to be a family soon. It was kind of funny seeing June go thru all the pregnancy issues and realizing even though she is a doctor she still needs someone to tell her about things she should know but since it is happening to her she does not see it. The town had quit a few things happen in this book that made them even closer if that is possible. I liked Myrna's little surprise she got from her pen pal. Jurea played a big part in helping out a member of the town. I really felt like I was a part of this community while reading this book and felt as if some new friends were made and old hatchets buried. I wish that Robyn Carr would have kept this series going like she did the Virgin River series I was sad to see it end. This was actually my favorite out of the three in the trilogy. 5 stars.,2,1987-03-03 03:29:33

299,18338465,Gunsmoke32,This book caused me so much heartache and pain. My heart felt the burn as it kept being torn apart. From just about everything that Haven said what she went through what Carmine and his family are going through and everything else in between. So much blood shed. If this book wasn't gifted to me I'm not even sure I would have ever read it. I had certainly never heard of it before and after reading the book summary (I didn't read it beforehand) it didn't sound like a story I would have been interested in reading. I can't thank my friend enough for gifting this book to me! It's one of my best reads and I can't wait to read more about this family!,3,2015-07-26 23:54:10
300,27384500,06085715,Freddie Venton has a degree in journalism but works in a coffee shop. She writes a student column for free for a local paper but wants to be a paid journalist writing about things she cares about. One night she is standing outside the coffee shop. Taking a break after serving a difficult customer when she see Nasreen Cudmore her old school friend who is now a police sergeant with The Met. Freddie tries to talk to Nasreen but Nasreen is embarassed and does not walk to talk. Nasreen is with her colleagues when they suddenly dash off. Freddie senses something has happened. She tells her boss she has a stomach bug and follows in a taxi on the chase of the scoop that will allow her to get a job on 'the nationals'. She follows them to a property and finds a PC being sick outside. Whilst the PC is distracted she finds a forensic suit which she hopes will allow her into the property ( I know this is ridiculous but will be explained in time). Once in the property she finds the blood splattered body of Alan Mardling  ex bank manager now internet troll. Nasreeen appears in the bedroom and asks what Freddie is doing. Freddie explains that she followed Nasreen on the chance of a news story. Nasreen's boss Supt Grey appears at the crime scene Freddie explains that Alan Mardling was on a troll site when he was murdered. When Freddie explains the workings of twitter etc the Supt assumes she is a policewoman. By looking at Twitter Freddie finds out that Mardling wrote abusive tweets to 15 yr old Paige Klinger a model. He was also threatened by a Mark Hamlin when he worked at the bank. Freddie immediately writes up the story and which gets picked up by the tabloids. When the Police find out they were made a fool of they arrest Freddie for impersonating a Police Officer. Supt Grey gives her an ultimatum either she becomes their advisers on the internet or they will press charges. Reluctantly Freddie becomes an adviser on the murder with Nasreen and her boss DCI Most. A few hours later a photo of Alan Mardlin's dead body appears on his Twitter account from Apolyon. Apolyon has millions of followers on Twitter and leaves a clue to his next victim who will be called Sophie and will be a cat lover. When Sophie is found murdered the police find out that Sophie had an argument over the internet with Hamlin about cat breeding. They arrest Hamlin but have to release him after finding no evidence. Then a 3rd victim is found a Dr Grape who tried to correct Apolyon's grammer. He also wrote a negative article about Paige Klinger and her use of emoticons. The police tried to bring Hamlin in for questioning but he has gone AWOL. In the background of the story we also find out that Nasreen and Freddie were best friends at school until a terrible tragedy occurred. Nasreen moved schools and never saw Freddie again. I enjoyed this story but you had to suspend reality a bit. *** SPOILER *** - There were 3 suspects in the story but they were only red herrings. The actual killer only had a bit part in the story until the grand finale when the killer was unveiled. I would like another story about Nasreen now an inspector and her team.,3,1960-06-19 20:06:49
301,18338465,reagansu,So basically I start out reading and I'm like: I'm thinking this is going to be an awesome book. But then the book just keeps going and going and going. It is so long. And here I am like: Where'd the action go? I was so thoroughly disappointed. To begin there is a girl named Haven who has been born into second generation slavery. She has been abused every day for practically her entire life. One day she runs away but then is caught and sold off to a man named Dr. DeMarco. At her new home she is treated with respect. And there she meets his two sons; Dominic and Carmine. So at this part of the story I'm like: Then Carmine and Haven meet and I'm just sitting here in a corner reading like: After that... It just goes down hill: I personally felt like there just wasn't any action. I just really don't see what all the hype is about this book. It was just dragging on. I really wasn't into it. You may be asking: Well if it was so disappointing then why three stars? Well let me explain. Even though the book got boring there were still many redeeming qualities. First of all this book has real substance. It's a powerful story about more than just love. It's about the will to live family and freedom. I relate this back to Haven. Even though she ha been abused her entire life she still has the will to wake up in the morning. She still pulls through. She is such a strong heroine and I loved that about this book. This story is refreshing and I've never read anything like it. I thought the romance between Haven and Carmine was really sweet. They would do anything for each other. It's a powerful love. "Right there in the moment it was just her and him no one and nothing else. They were all that mattered - two people desperately in love and wanting to show each other. No master and slave no class divides." There were such blurred the lines between good and bad. Sometimes good people have hard lives and are put into tough situations. I never new when I was supposed to hate someone. (Well... Correction: I did hate some people) "Could someone do bad things and not be a bad person?" Also the beginning was really good. It had me hooked. The problem is it didn't keep me hooked. I recommend this book for anyone looking for a powerful unique read.,5,1983-11-26 09:49:35

305,32603159,aglecavalier333,Our final and main objective is to consider the emergence of the Indian Ocean as the center of 21st century maritime container commerce with Sri Lanka as the hub and Africa becoming an essential vector. We will concentrate on the modern period the macro-geographic data and situations in and around the Indian Ocean and on one particular aspect: the development of the hub-and-spoke model for the network of maritime connections in around and beyond the Indian Ocean as for container commerce. We will insist on the hub itself Sri Lanka which is presently changing rapidly; on some of the various harbors around the Indian Ocean and their goods transportation inland networks essentially railroads and highways; the projects in that field particularly the New Silk Road of the Chinese; the bottlenecks of the Suez Canal and the Straight of Malacca; and the dead end of the Persian Gulf except as the starting point of a hinterland network that will develop when the wars and insecurity there are stabilized. We will envisage the various routes beyond and the final destinations. We will only mention the railroad connection between Asia and Europe using the trans-Siberian railroad and beyond to Hamburg and Madrid as a competing alternative. We will also eventually show how backward in that field of container maritime commerce the USA are backward as compared to the world and absent from the Indian Ocean and the China Seas as an actor in that container maritime commerce. We will then move to the various organizations that have direct interests in the development of this hub and spoke network of maritime connections and routes in the Indian Ocean. But this will lead to the security problem to manage the movements of the ships (to avoid flags of convenience) and the various trafficking activities that are to be contained (human trafficking; smuggling weapons military equipment and various goods; and criminal activities of any other type) with the challenge of who can do it and how. We will then see clearly the stake attached to the re-emergence of human trafficking and slavery in this vast area. This security problem is central due to piracy and trafficking. Digitalized satellite surveillance will have to be set up for the whole Indian Ocean. What role will the USA and Europe play now the New Silk Road with the Silk Railway from China to Germany reached Spain on December 9 2014 and the maritime Silk Road has reached Western Europe for some time already? The Chinese are taking contacts in Afghanistan to open after the departure of the Americans the link between Kazakhstan and Gwadar harbor Pakistan. China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd and other Chinese companies are involved in harbor equipment and railroad development all around the Indian Ocean. Our general hypothesis is that the present evolution is the refoundation of what existed up to 1433 and the Indian Ocean is becoming again the center of the world's maritime commerce under the strong pioneering leadership of the Chinese so far Dr Jacques COULARDEAU,1,1970-05-08 02:05:56

It kinda felt like the author was working with a checklist. #1: Make sure hero uses the words "mine" and "belong to me" often and tries to feed the heroine throughout the book. #2 Make sure hero gets jealous over everything. #3 Make sure hero and heroine are in lust with each other and have lots of sex. #4 Put heroine in danger and make it obvious who the bad guy is. Make sure the cliffhanger is obvious after the first few chapters. I like steamy reads with "alpha male" characters but this just didn't do it for me.,2,1987-03-20 16:00:32
310,1059682,beslangeroy,This was one of my first book reports I ever did at school. My teacher then (this was 4th grade) had a dim view of what she called "scary authors". She preferred classic books that taught a lesson - Silas Marner for example. I chose to do a report on From the Dust Returned because it was Ray Bradbury and I felt his work was no different from the Silas Marners of the book world. To my pleasure this was lyrical a drift of prose in the dusty twilight of Cecy's remarkable family. It was fantasy for me and I was inwardly tickled to share this with my class. Even my teacher told me that she had never realised that an author such as Ray Bradbury could write something like this. It's really a beautiful haunting book.,2,1955-03-31 12:33:17

Carmine knows exactly how damaging his fathers lifestyle/career can be he has lived through the horrible details. Acting out and getting into trouble are his way of dealing with the haunting memories and grief. Carmine knew he would never end up like his father and sell his soul he never wanted to have blood on his hands. Vincent DeMarco never wanted this for himself either and it was the last thing he wanted for his boys but sometimes love makes you do crazy things. This is why he ended up buying Haven and bringing her to his home. Haven has been a slave since the moment she was born he mother being one as well she always wondered what else was out there in this world. So when her mama told her to run for help Haven ran and ran only it didn't get her too far. She never made it to get help but she was taken away from her horrible life by Dr. Vincent DeMarco and went to work for him. The DeMarco House was a different environment to Haven having the ability to roam the house freely eat whatever food she may want have a bed and nice clothes. She was even able to make friends with Vincent's sons Dominic and Carmine. Although she was still a bit frightened to be around Carmine the electricity in the air between them was too confusing for her. Haven had no idea of the world and the way things worked so this was a huge learning experience. As time went on Carmine and Haven fell in love Carmine wanted to help Haven enjoy every aspect of the world only Vincent was not very pleased with this. Secrets of Haven's life could bring danger to them all and Carmine needed to know exactly what those secrets were to keep Haven Safe. Only it turns out she was apart of his demons from his past and the very reason he has no choice but to follow in his father's footsteps.,4,1993-07-22 12:17:03
312,18488643,philnunn,B.L. Wilde out does herself with her new book Desire. This book is full of suspense erotica heartbreak and love. I was very happy with this book even though I didn't want the end to truly be the end. You truly want the best for both characters but at the same time you wonder how they will get together safely. Jade has a little less than five years left with The Seductors which means she is solely theirs to use as they need. The Seductors are a business full of men and women willing to use their bodies beauty and sometimes sex to get what their client needs. Clients of The Seductors want different things mostly about getting what they want from others that they aren't able to get one their own. With Jade being on of the best female seductors she was placed in a top mission involving a CEO of a weapons company Oliver. The moment Jade laid eyes on her target she knew she was going to be in deep with this one. The only thing is falling in love with Oliver could be a death warrant for them both. Although Oliver keeps trying everything in his power to help Jade fall in love with him because he loves her with everything he has. Jade has a decision to make will she complete the mission and break Oliver's heart? Or will she tell him the truth and hope they can survive The Seductors? Desire kept me eager to continue reading to find out what Jade decides to do. All of the emotions throughout the book was incredible it was like you were feeling what the characters were feeling. B.L Wilde did an outstanding job with this book.,1,2018-02-05 22:52:18
313,19271668,kota1987,For me this was a different type of romance style/genre. I haven't really had an opportunity to get into romances featuring modern day Native Americans before and now that I have am looking forward to exploring it more. I thought the story got a little iffy in a few spots when the author was trying to keep the mystique/paranormal side of the story and the traditions of the Native Americans. Although I know that you don't want to over-focus on things unless you want to risk the story coming off tedious I do wish she'd explored a bit more into the the on-goings with the sweat lodge and culture. Other than that I loved the concept and the blending of history mysticism the modern world and the relationship that grew from it and despite so many differences.,1,2016-06-01 07:45:26

315,1381580,jets11,First Sentence: He was coming down the hill when they struck. Norman soldier Ralph Delchard and Breton lawyer Gervase Bret travel around Britain to resolve disputes to ensure the information in King Henry's Domesday Book is correct. Archenfield in Herefordshire is situated in the English/Welsh border. There is a conflict as to who owns the land. When the men arrive a wealthy landowner and principal witness to the conflict has just been burned alive in his home a Welch lion filled with blood curved into the soil in front of his house. Marston's writing has a wonderful voice. His characters come to life for me. The two men Ralph and Gervase are companions and friends but opposite in temperament. They travel with the often annoying Canon Hubert and Brother Simon who is terrified of women. We learn a bit more about Ralph as he talks about his late wife. In this book we have Idwal the Welch Archdeacon about whom even Brother Simon comments "Blessed are the deaf...for they cannot hear him." It is that humor that offsets the occasionally gruesome action. Marston's books make me think of Shakespeare; exciting suspenseful battle scenes and sword fights duplicity betrayal humor and a touch of romance. There is a wonderful discussion between Richard Orbec an English landowner and Ralph about war being murder. Marston's sense of time place and historical detail is wonderful. There was one portent which I shall forgive a surprising twist and an ending I loved. I highly recommend this book and series to anyone who loves historical mysteries.

316,30300862,paraskivairina,If you enjoyed The Goldfinch you will like On the Edge of the Loch by Joseph Earnon Cummins. The story takes you deep inside the hearts and minds of two people wounded by life's misfortunes. It is a story of love sacrifice and healing. Through each twist and turn of the plot a little more of each character's inner thoughts and motivations are revealed. As each character develops and explores his or her relationship with the wild Irish countryside the setting takes on a life of its own becoming yet another actor in the drama that enfolds. The ending is surprising yet satisfying. The language is poetic although at times it slows the action of the plot. Nevertheless it is fascinating reading and I highly recommend it.

Talvez a minha avaliacao de apenas tres estrelas pareca injusta mas e a MINHA avaliacao apenas da historia e nao de toda a sua importancia na literatura. Nao sendo o meu genero predileto (talvez por ainda nao ter lido o suficiente para aprender a gostar) nao adorei as historias. Gostei um pouco achei-as engracadas mas falta algo... Esse algo talvez seja a falta de empatia que ainda sinto pelas personagens.

321,18338465,pokrovskywx,I love this book. The story of a reluctant Mafia prince and a slave girl trying to fight the odds stacking against them was beautiful and engaging love story with spills of blood along the way. I love Carmine! He could be an ass sometimes but he also had a good heart. When he ran his mouth the things that came out of them were amusing. "Your body is your temple and I won't come in it unless you want me to." The moment the words left his lips he laughed to himself. "That sounds so fucking wrong. I didn't mean it that way." I also love Haven - how strong she was but at the same time had a child-like naivety due to underexposure to the real world. I love reading how their relationship blossomed slowly. They were absolutely endearing. One of favorite scene was when he was teaching her how to drive. That was funny. When things seemed peachy for them the hard truth of who she really was came out. It turned out she was the reason his mother was killed . As much as he loved her there were days when he got sucked into his bad days and blamed her for it. And she just took it with grace. I love Dominic too. He was so nice to her going all out trying to make her feel normal and part of the family. I even love Nicholas with his stupid jokes! I was so sad that he got caught in between crossfire and it broke my heart even more with how his body was 'laid to rest' . When Haven was abducted  everything went wrong. And after all Vincent did to prevent Carmine from joining the Mafia  that's exactly what he did because he couldn't find other way to save her. As Haven said it: "I think sometimes good men find themselves doing bad things." I think it's was the sentiment of the whole book - nothing really what it seemed. I adore this book and really looking forward to see what would happen next. My only complaint is there were several Italian phrases in the book. Some with English translation but some were not. I wish there were all translated because there were time when reading I wasn't accessible to the internet to find the meaning.,2,1978-02-08 14:24:52

323,30741810,shnyra88,Author Belsky was most recently managing editor of news for NBCNews.com and is a former managing editor for the New York Daily News among other journalistic posts. He has ample experience to write authoritatively about his main character and first-person narrator Gil Malloy a down-on-his luck Daily News reporter and about the book's Manhattan setting. The Kennedy Connection is the first in the Gil Malloy series and takes place in 2013 as the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's assassination approaches. When we meet Malloy he's been disgraced after a serious breach of journalistic ethics. Though he kept his job he's assigned to the newsroom dregs while he watches another young reporter Carrie Bratten acquire the mantle of up-and-comer that he once wore. Frustrated with his second-class citizenship he's a little too quick to latch onto a story he thinks will redeem him. Meanwhile his former agent asks him to help her get publicity for a new book. The hook? The author claims to be Lee Harvey Oswald Jr. illegitimate son of Kennedy's assassin. Oswald Jr. believes the book will clear his father's name. And a police buddy asks him to investigate the death of a young ex-gang member from the South Bronx Victor Reyes. Reyes was shot 15 years earlier left a paraplegic and finally died when the bullet lodged in his spine worked loose and traveled to his heart. The unknown malefactor who shot him is now a murderer. Malloy's friend is killed by a drunk driver before the reporter can do more than conduct a few initial interviews with family and cops on that case. Now one is a serious drunk and another's a deputy police commissioner. These distractions are soon cut short when a series of murders begins each with a Kennedy half-dollar left at the scene. These deaths seem too much of a coincidence taking into account the revelations of the new book by Oswald Jr. especially when someone sends Malloy a letter promising more mayhem. In the envelope a Kennedy half-dollar. Malloy is teamed up with Bratten to cover this high-profile story and again riding high in his journalistic world. Author Belsky does a good job making Malloy a likeable character who could use a little more personal insight. The other newsroom characters are also well drawn and there's some engaging banter. Just like Jake Epping in Stephen King's 11/22/63 the character of Oswald Jr. is trying to rewrite the history of JFK's assassination and like Jake ends up having second thoughts about meddling with the past. Efforts to deconstruct what Malloy calls "the greatest murder mystery in history" have a substantial literary pedigree from King's work to Don DeLillo's Libra to James Ellroy's American Tabloid to Tim Baker's Fever City. Belsky has made an engaging contribution to this lineage.,3,1960-03-05 09:37:17

327,18338465,sepehrair,5 No compren la ediciA3n de bolsillo STARS Esta no es una reseA+-a es un berrinche. Exagerado ridAculo y con la misma paciA3n y necedad con la que una toddler se siente justificada para gritar y tirarse al piso en una tienda departamental. AsA que ya estA!n advertidos. Pop reading Challenge 2016 A Book And Its Prequel Si quieren leer mi reseA+-a principal de este libro click aquA. Esta es una opiniA3n sobre la EdiciA3n Pocket Star. Primero un poco de contextualizaciA3n: Sempre es un libro que amo con cada cA(c)lula de mi cuerpo. Lo leA por primera vez en el aA+-o 2013 y desde entonces lo he releAdo unas 30 veces aproximadamente. Esta historia me ha sacado de resacas literarias a veces cuando no se me antoja nada que leer releo mis partes favoritas y siempre me pone una sonrisa en el rostro. Hace un par de dAas una chica me comento que habAa varias ediciones de este libro y que tenAan varios cambios. Por su puesto no me podAa quedar con la duda. La ediciA3n que yo habAa leAdo es una publicaciA3n del 2012. Tontamente creA que la ediciA3n mas reciente era la que esta disponible en Amazon ( si lo repito fue tontamente). Ya habAa visto varios comentarios quejA!ndose del precio (mi esposo entre los mas quejosos) y si es caro pero bueno amo este libro asA que fucked lo compre. Pague $11 dA3lares mas taxes POR UN EBOOK sin darme cuenta que era la ediciA3n de bolsillo de solo 300 paginas cuando la ediciA3n original es de mas de 500 paginas. Y como el kindle no te seA+-ala el numero de paginas que tiene el libro no me di cuenta de este detalle hasta que estaba leyendo el libro y empecA(c) a notar que le faltaban escenas importantes. Ahora imaginen mi reacciA3n o mejor aun pA3nganse en mi lugar. Piensen en su libro favorito que mas aman y que han leAdo tantas veces que casi se lo saben de memoria. Llega una editorial y PUM lo despedaza. Mi pregunta es simple. Porque carajos lo hacen y nos lo venden con precio de una novela completa? Le recortaron cosas a la historia por todos lados. Desde lAneas y fragmentos hasta capAtulos enteros. Y sin tener cuidado de mantener una historia con sentido Ejemplo: SPOILER ALERT En la noche de baile Haven es atacada por Lisa Nicolas la salva y le dice a Carmine que Lisa la ataco OTRA VEZ. Porque en la versiA3n original Lisa ataca a Haven en la fiesta de Hallowen perooooooooo en esta versiA3n quitaron esa escena por lo tanto ese pequeA+-o OTRA VEZ no tiene sentido. Y hablando de la fiesta de Hallowen en la versiA3n original se ve la confrontaciA3n entre Lisa y Haven que lleva a la pelea de Carmine lo cual es sAoper intenso. En esta versiA3n quitaron todo eso y Carmine se pelea por un simple comentario y hacen ver a Carmine como un celoso exagerado. Otro cambio pequeA+-o pero muy significante en el aniversario de la muerte de Maura Carmine le advierte a Haven que no se acerque a su padre. AquA ni siquiera le habla ese dAa y llegamos a la escena del cuarto con Vincent sin ese suspenso que en el original. Escenas lindas como la platica entre Dia y Carmine donde el acepta por primera vez sus sentimientos por Haven. CORTADA Todo el capitulo de dAa de gracias. CORTADO Carmine y su aventura con la hija del director CORTADA que a su vez deja sin explicaciA3n porque Carmine la pasa tan mal en el campamento. Y asA me puedo seguir y seguir con lo horrible que destazaron una historia a la que amo tanto. AsA que entenderA!n mi enojo al ver lo mucho que le robaron a la esencia de la historia original. Lo Aonico que le aumentaron a la historia en esta ediciA3n son las escenas erA3ticas. La primera vez que Carmine le da un orgasmo a Haven es mucho mas explAcito tenemos mas descripciones de su cuerpo espalda y lo bien que se le marcaban las playeras. En conclusiA3n: Si quieren leer esta historia no compren la ediciA3n que esta en venta en amazon o chequen que sea la que tiene mas de 500 paginas. Odie esta versiA3n pero igual fue una buena relectura y me entretuve distinguiendo todos los cambios.,2,1988-09-14 15:37:08

Time heals all wounds . It has to. the story was vast in landscape. The writer took her time building the relationship of Haven and Carmine which  I thought  slowed the tempo of the story.

332,11827783,zakiabdelwahed,This graphic novel is an origin story of Sherlock Holmes. It includes the introduction to Dr. Watson and a back story as to how they became roommates and partners. It has an interesting mystery that introduces us to Dr. Moriarty (and boy is he evil) and sets up their rivalry quite well. It wasn't a great mind-blowing mystery but still good and I felt like this collection was more of a set up for future graphic novels than anything. I thought the graphic novel had very good artwork. I didn't like that the characters had purple skin. There is a possibility that was just because I was reading it on my nook and maybe the colors were off.,5,1991-12-06 22:58:18

334,27384500,hoogenboezemjg,I was so excited when it was announced Angela Clarke had FINALLY signed a deal for a fiction book - and a crime thriller no less. I loved her non-fiction book Confessions of a Fashionista and I was dead excited to read Follow Me and I have to say I was super impressed with this book! It's one of the most fast paced crime thrillers I've ever read. You literally spend the whole novel on tenterhooks waiting for Apollyon to strike again. Who knew a Twitter serial killer could be so absorbing and so bloody hard to identify? I genuinely got the fright of my life when Apollyon was revealed. Legit scared. I thought it was someone else was SURE it was someone else (and I apologise profusely but usually when a copper gives a girl a lift home HE'S THE CULPRIT) and got the fright of my life when the true killer was unmasked. GOB SMACKED. This was an interesting novel considering Freddie sort of stumbles into the whole crime scene thing and the novel in general. And she irritated me a little bit in the typical fashion of heroine who knows nowt about crime scenes ends up causing trouble or contaminating the scene etc. For someone supposedly streetwise she was a bit dim sometimes. Nasreen on the other hand was an interesting prospect and I never really felt that we got to see the real Nasreen. It always felt as if we were kept at arms length holding her emotions in check compared to Freddie who literally vommed at each crime scene and couldn't hold her stuff together. This was such a frantic read that it was hard to really absorb it all but I really enjoyed the breakneck pace. The only thing that slowed it down was the secret from the past as Nasreen and Freddie knew each other way back (and by way back I mean like 5 years ago because they're only 23) and there was this secret hanging over them which seemed wasted if only because it was rushed. Also: in 2006 these girls were NOT on Facebook they were on MySpace or Bebo. Facebook was literally still all college back then and only just open to the public so no way these girls knew about it yet. I'm also unsure if you can be a copper at 23 but again I'll let it slide if only cos I can't be bothered to check (it just seems quite young but I don't know how the training academies and stuff work over here in the UK so I may be way off base and 16 year old can be coppers). I may be wrong but the ending seemed to lead me to a sequel which would be AMAZING. I think there's still so much more of Freddie and Nasreen to be discovered. We need to see Freddie be more serious a bit less reckless (because that gets you in to trouble) and more emotions from Nasreen. I want to know what makes her tick. Angela Clarke is a fine fine writer. I LOVE thrillers that are at a breakneck pace because there's nothing worse than a slow thriller. If I could have had any thing more from this novel it would have been more from Apollyon. It would have been interesting to see his thoughts too but only because there's clearly a tiny part of me that's a serial killer. JK. I'm ALL serial killer. So yes more please Angela I love your style.,4,1972-11-25 23:49:08

340,11455127,martinuskowal,Why did I choose to read Party of Three? Well I'm always on the lookout for erotic menage books and while M/M/F is my favorite I was interested in this M/F/M because there are cops and ex-boyfriends and I have been wanting to try this author. Mira Adams and Ethan West are in a loving stable relationship. Ethan has left the law enforcement agency H.O.T (which stands for "Hostage Ops Team" - but let's face it - "HOT" - might deserve a little giggle snort) and has gone to law school and is now a lawyer. He is busy and the quality time spent with Mira is suffering. With Mira's birthday coming up  they both want to get their relationship and sex life back on track. Ethan takes her to a secluded cabin but has a big surprise for her. He has invited her ex-boyfriend Rogan Wolfe (who also works for H.O.T) to come join them. Recently Mira had told Adam one of her fantasies was to have another man join them in the bedroom. Mira never thought Ethan would act on that fantasy and is shocked and nervously excited when Rogan shows up. First let me say Lacey Alexander writes really good sex scenes. They are explicit dirty and if you are looking for a book where you just want the hot sex and don't care about the relationship stuff you would probably enjoy this book. I never got tired of the sex it didn't feel repetitive. While there is sex on the beach sex on a boat sex pretty much everywhere in the cabin my favorite sex scene is in the kitchen with Mira's birthday cake (which is cheesecake). I think we might need an excerpt from this scene: And then - oh God yes yes yes - there was Ethan using his fingers to smudge still more of her birthday cake onto his erection struggling a little to make it stay but then holding the shaft down level and turning back toward her. By which time she'd never felt more ravenous in her life. "Open wide" he said. And she couldn't help thinking everything about him looked utterly delicious in that moment - not just his cheesecake-covered cock but his entire body from head to toe. I'm not sure if Ethan should win a medal for balancing cheesecake on his cock or using it as a spork. Either way I'm impressed Ethan. So the sex is fun in this book. But there is a lot that I didn't like as well. The core of this story is that Ethan and Mira think their relationship needs work. Needs some kind of spark to make it better. So maybe bringing Rogan in and opening Mira up sexually might help the situation. A lot of time in this book is focused on Rogan and Mira's old feelings. They broke up but having sex together for a weekend brings up those feelings. Rogan feels like he can't let her go again. Mira feels very conflicted and starts to feel real things towards him. Even at one point Ethan feels extremely jealous. All things I liked seeing and agree with. But then the book ends so abruptly. I felt like Ethan and Mira's issues are not addressed at all. We actually don't even get that much POV from Ethan. Being the hero of the story this disturbed me. I needed to feel like Ethan and Mira were back on track to a steady relationship and I did not feel like that at the end. We get so much time invested in Rogan for nothing to come of it. I was really let down by the conclusion of this book. For all the sex there are still three people who started having intermingling feelings and I was definitely invested in how it would all turn out.

341,17183712,superw,** spoiler alert ** This book is the first book I've read with May-December in Reverse position (older woman - young man). And somehow I can't really feel the age difference between the two characters. Pearl is young at heart (Really?? Mountain climbing at the age of 40?? Seriously??) While Alexandre is a stinking billionaire at the age of 25. How twisted is that? The story is OK. Although I can't really feel "feelings" when Alexandre found out who Pearl really is and he just acted angry. And the how Alexandre and his sister's life before entered the story didn't quite made an entrance. I wish it could be more shocking and revealing and caught in the moment so it could made it worth while reading it. And why am I feeling that the reason Alexandre's past lovers (i think all were older woman) were all older than him is because he's wants a motherly attention? Or is just the norm of may-december relationship that us people think? Also I noticed something. I don't know if i read it wrong or what but before they were talking about Pearl's boss Natalie? And I think it was Alexandre who was saying that Natalie is a common name? But Pearl haven't said that Natalie was her boss's name. It happened early in the book. Anyone can enlighten me about it?,3,2003-11-16 21:05:56

343,23626289,neelaeva,Klappentext/Inhalt: Auf den ersten Blick ist alles perfekt: Dawson lebt noch und niemand scheint nach ihm zu suchen. Katy wehrt sich nicht langer gegen ihre Gefuhle fur Daemon und alles konnte so schon sein - aber es ist nur die Ruhe vor dem Sturm. Plotzlich ist Blake zuruck und mit ihm ein gewagter Plan. Zu Katys grossem Erstaunen bittet er sie um Hilfe. Katy weiss nicht was sie tun soll denn Blake ist nicht zu trauen das hat sie schon einmal schmerzlich zu spuren bekommen. Doch fur ihre Freunde - und fur Daemon - wurde sie alles tun. Selbst ihr eigenes Leben aufs Spiel setzen. Dies ist der dritte Band der Obsidian-Serie von Jennifer L. Armentrout. Meine Meinung: Im Februar habe ich Band 02 gelesen und das Ende war wirklich fies. Deshalb war fur mich klar dass ich dieses Buch im Marz lesen muss. Ich hatte einige Erwartungen und vieles wurde auch erfullt. Katy hat in letzter Zeit echt so einiges erlebt. Sie hat erfahren was ihre Nachbarn wirklich sind musste um ihr Uberleben kampfen hat viele Dinge ertragen mussen aber dennoch versucht sie das beste daraus zu machen. Katy ist sehr glucklich dass jemand wieder da ist. Alle denken es kann nur besser werden aber da haben sich alle geirrt. Jetzt geht es erst so richtig los. Es passieren immer wieder merkwurdige Dinge Leute tauchen auf die es nicht sollten sie mussen jemanden befreien und dann kommt doch alles ganz anders. Katy ist auf der einen Seite glucklich dass jemand wieder da ist aber sie merkt schnell dass es ihm nicht gut. Sie will ihn unterstutzen jemanden zu befreien. Dafur muss sie sich oftmals ganz schon aus dem Fenster lehnen muss Daomen von Dingen uberzeugen und sich mal wieder grossen Gefahren stellen. Der zweite Band hatte wirklich einen miesen Cliffhanger und deshalb musste ich sofort weiterlesen. Ein wenig Angst hatte ich dass ich auch hier wieder so meine Probleme habe dass es langamtige Stellen gibt und das mir die Entwicklung der Geschichte vielleicht nicht gefallt. Was soll ich sagen ich fand den dritten Band bisher am besten. Endlich geht die Geschichte aber auch die Beziehung voran. Wir erfahren hier einige interessante Dinge. Die Action kommt nicht zu kurz und noch vieles mehr. Ich dachte ja dass Band 02 schon einen miesen Cliffhanger hat aber was soll ich hier sagen! Es ist so fies ein Buch so enden zu lassen und ich freue mich riesig auf Band 04! Fazit: Dieser Band war fur mich bisher der beste. Wir haben hier genugend Action aber auch die Liebesgeschichte ist total schon. Daneben erfahren wir intersannte Dinge und neue Bundnisse schliessen sich. Das Ende ist sowas von fies und ich freue mich sehr auf den vierten Band. Bewertung: Cover: 5/5 Klappentext: 5/5 Inhalt: 45/5 Schreibstil: 45/5 Gesamtpaket: 45/5 45 von 5 Sterne,1,1953-07-31 14:46:50
344,18338465,panjan,5++++++ Stars! Because nothing can get better than this! Once upon a time a certain someone here on GR somehowduring a random conversation with me through PM because I was too pissed off at a certain author for writing what she called a mafia romance mentioned the Sempre series. (Even though alot of breaks came in and made my reading not so much of in one go..) And after sometime.. I finally got around to reading them! And.. Where dafuq has this been ALL MY LIFE?!! I had no idea that I was missing out on such a gem! I might have come across this series sometime later because of my addiction to mafia romances but I am glad it was a recommendation. And that's why it kept revolving around my in head! Haven..oh Haven.. I have never ever been in love with a heroine so much (maybe except for Judith McNaught's ladies) but my Goodness... This book broke my heartshredded it into pieces but got it all back in one shape again. Haven's innocent spirit her beauty her sad life and her ability of loving like no other.. And her desire for freedom. I really cried with this one. With the cruelties of the world because even though this was entirely fictional people do go through nightmares like these their entire lives. Beautiful and innocent girls who deserve all the happiness in the world just die inside and lose their spirits. Needless to say I am a huge fan of JM Darhower now. The way she wrote this story... This stuff was legendary to me. It was a perfect blend of everything. I really like books with a third person/omniscient POV because they tell the story from all aspects and make it much much better! I mean.. I am never on good terms with long books because it's hard to keep up since they tend to get boring.. But honestly. I enjoyed every single word. I was damn glad it was long!,3,1979-08-28 11:17:07

348,25822224,qbuenicimo18,A great anthology with some very erotic stories about men in kilts. There are a few historicals as well as contemporary tales and most have a highly erotic content.

349,18777580,maxguk,I don't know how she does it but Mary Ann Rivers has taken the most unlikable character from Live (the first book in the Burnside Series) and turned him into someone my heart positively aches for. This book is one of the most shining illustrations of the notion that what you see isn't always what you get when it comes to fucked up humans. And it's amazing.

350,15156124,disinter,This is a Quickie Review. For the full review please visit The Romanceaholic. Expected Release Date: June 5 2012 Publisher: Self Published Imprint: N/A Author's Website: zoewintersbooks.com My Source for This Book: Amazon.com Part of a Series: Yes Book 3 Preternaturals Series Best Read In Order: Yes Steam Level: Steamy I would definitely recommend that new readers go back and pick up the earlier stories in the series before reading this one. As someone who has read the entire series but has forgotten much of the details I found myself struggling to follow along at times and while I think Ms. Winters did an admirable job of making this book stand alone I do feel like I missed out on how meaningful some of the events actually were in the context of the series. That said I did enjoy it. While not as heavy on the steam as many paranormal romances there was plenty of chemistry and romance to be had in the meantime. While I did wish that Fiona had a little less hormonal reaction to Z and a little more emphasis on the agoraphobia I enjoyed her character immensely. I also really enjoyed how Z's behavior was not typical for a jaguar shifter since that made his reaction to Fiona quite a bit more meaningful in my mind. Overall while I personally think that previous fans of the series are going to benefit most from this story I would recommend it for fans of reformed rakes agoraphobic heroines and reunited lovers. 4/5 Stars,2,1958-12-25 13:07:17
351,18338465,hlyubovjbuh1983c,I loved this book!! It was a beautiful yet quietly powerful read. It was an emotional roller coaster. That's all I will say.,2,1994-06-26 13:42:53
352,10803536,eduardherzog,I appreciate firstreads giving me the opportunity to read and review this ARC. I must say that I really enjoyed this book. It was such a fun read. This was a sci/fi thriller based on the premis that man has been able to control the weather and then weaponizing it. This is a conspiracy theorist's dream come true and I'm sure many of such will say this is based on real technology. This book is set in Antarctica where special technology has been placed to control the weather. The genius behind it has gone rogue and the company has ousted him and replaced him with a woman who has been his nemisis. In his anger he enters code in the system that takes everything over and unleashes his fury on the world causing mass disasters. The people that are left behind have to try to stop the destruction before the system takes them out as well. This is certainly a thrill ride that keeps your attention and makes this one book thats hard to put down.,5,1957-08-29 11:35:17

354,18338465,doregon,Actual rating: 3.5 stars I liked it but it was becoming a bit tedious at some point. I also didn't particularly care for any of the characters which disappointed me greatly but oh well. Anyway I did enjoy reading this so definitely 3.5 stars (:,5,1993-02-18 09:52:32

356,15710450,teddybal65,I enjoy picture book biographies of every sort and especially the artist bios published by Eerdmans Books for Young Readers. Rousseau's story really appeals because his life inspires; self-taught following a dream later in life exploring nature taking criticism without giving up. All the while his story is being told the illustrations reflect his style and subject matter. A masterpiece. (and an award winner too.),2,1967-01-01 12:23:46
357,18338465,awpebash,Overall I really enjoyed this book. The characters were thoroughly developed. The author would only give enough information to clue you in but not give everything away. My only complaint is it seemed to drag on. I felt there could have been more editing to pare down and make the story move quickly. Now generally I love longer books or series so that is not a factor in this critique. The plot is primarily about Haven a slave who is brought to the home of a mafia higher up. Carmine the son of said mafia member has a huge chip on his shoulder from his mother's death. Through time and circumstance Carmine and Haven are drawn together. They come to realize their lives are much more entwined than they knew. Will the secrets of the past get them killed. Can Carmine and Haven have any future at all given their life? There is another book in this series which I plan to read the same length as this one so a little daunting given the slower pace of the first. I do feel you could stop after book one and not be left hanging (although I do wish the ending had been a bit different).,2,1965-08-21 17:00:05
358,32726388,cinini2000,This is a book of short stories that I've heard described as "dark". I don't know if I would classify these stories as dark but they are about broken and flawed people (aren't we all in one way or another?). Although the characters in this book are going through some difficult times I can't help but get the impression that life will get easier for them in the future. In that way the book offers some unspoken hope that made me want to keep reading. That might not be what the author intended at all but that's what I got from it.,5,1961-01-24 12:42:55

360,8061597,bakbaura,Sameland tells the story of two blokes who wanting to earn some fast cash set out to start a Sami amusement park. Full of grand ideas but no stamina to follow them through or doing it legally doesn't stop Roy and Leif nor does the fact that neither of them have abosolutely any knowledge at all about Samic culture or about what it takes to run a business. The big plan doesn't exactly go as planned for the boys. They meet many obstacles along the way among them two vengeful Finnish guys an angry Russian sailor/vodka dealer a flagpole-sawing Sami hater a shaman/drag queen with stage fright and women who by their very presence seem to screw things up for Roy and Leif. This is not a book you'll remember for very long. It's not deep or meaningful in any way nor does it try to be. This book was written solely for the purpose of entertaining you. And it does it really really does. The boys end up in the craziest (yet not impossible it's still probable scenarios) situations where they make bad even worse by their own wrong turns and boy is it funny! It also has a very satisfying goes-around-comes-around ending. I really liked this book. Not every book you read has to have a deep meaning; this one entertained me from page one. And it really is refreshing; a book that's not bloated with its own self-importance (which I kind of think there's a shortage of in Norwegian literature). Definitely giving the thumbs up for Sameland. Great debut.,2,2005-05-12 01:26:47
361,711002,magometmerzoeva,I must admitthat after I'd read the Morgaine saga I'd been put of reading other Cherryh books for a while. The monotony of those books wasn't doing it for me. The Pride of Chanur however has more action and allows Cherryh to describe a star spanning society of multiple races all with their unique psychologies where a human is the alien.,2,1997-12-01 13:19:42
362,27384500,kawboy88,This was a really compelling thriller with a strong modern presence. I was kept guessing right up to about two pages before the identity of the #murderer was revealed. It took me a little while to get into the story. I felt fairly indifferent towards the main character Freddie so it was only when the action started to build that I got interested. The premise of a murderer who leaves clues on Twitter was really gripping. I was itching to see how that whole scenario began and the way the account was found was not a let down. Freddie as a main character was fine. I didn't love her I didn't hate her. She was just fine. There wasn't really anything about her that bothered me but there wasn't anything that I could connect or relate to either. But that's just me. I think the way she reacted to events was incredibly realistic particularly towards the end where the case ramped up a whole lot. It was refreshing to see a main character who hadn't been trained to deal with these situations really struggle with everything that was going on around her. The mystery of the Hashtag Murderer was great. It was fast-paced and the development of the police investigation was fairly believable. Well except for the fact that every police officer on the case has zero clue regarding social media. I was quite surprised by who turned out to be the murderer though I had taken notice of the character previously just for a different reason. Looking back the reasons that I had taken notice of the character were definitely hints that they were the killer. Basically it was really well written. I was a little underwhelmed when we found out about this big terrible thing that Nas and Freddie did when they were younger. I mean sure it was bad but I was expecting something much worse. Something dramatic that maybe pushed Nas into become a police officer. Overall this was a really exciting thriller/crime novel. It's a brilliant debut for the author and someone I'll definitely be checking out when more books are released. I'd definitely recommend this even if like me you're not a big thriller reader. *I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review* This review was originally posted on my blog: https://onelittlebookshelf.wordpress....,2,1984-04-08 21:15:43

365,1514278,chrisgbee2,The stories are interesting but the author's tendency to put herself into the text was off-putting and an annoyance. I found her pretentious and didn't appreciate how she seemed to think herself an expert in psychology. I'm not saying she might not be correct in certain cases but the way she presented her "diagnoses" made it sound like those were the concrete conclusions. I have my doubts. Very dated and uninspired with surprisingly many typos.,5,1988-10-20 15:18:12

368,18588529,albovis,I don't like scary movies or books. Just has never been my cup of tea. However once in a while it is nice to step out of your comfort zone. I actually read the entire book from start to finish and enjoyed the story.,4,2003-03-05 08:57:04
369,12369705,forauth,Reviewing books from writer friends is a special privilege. Reviewing fictional stories that catch my attention is even better. Theresa Sneed's debut novel "No Angel" is a special story about a guardian angel who didn't want to be a guardian angel. Jonathan Stewart had issues. He was assigned to watch over a special girl on earth but he was counting the days when he would be released from his "calling". From the affects of his mysterious past Jonathan was grumpy and all business. With a great imagination and some experience with the spirit realm Theresa Sneed writes an intriguing story which takes many twists and turns. An unexpected adventure into the underworld captivates the reader until the very satisfying end. As I read this story it reminded me of my deceased husband so this story has a special meaning for me. Many others apparently have felt the same way as readers are saying it has given them comfort to read about what may happen in the Spirit World. It's a great read and I'd recommend it to anyone.,3,1962-11-20 20:59:03
370,18338465,anapolack,Beautiful wonderful heart-breaking character development. I am in awe of the amount of depth given to every character in this book and trust me when I say that it was something truly spectacular.

371,18071375,Antonieth15,ARC provided by author for an honest review. 2.5 Stars Jake and Ana are into each other but she's his fiance's daughter? I get what the author was trying to do but yikes! Once you get past that initial cringe factor the story takes off. Jake and Ana seem right for each other other than the fact that she's a mess. She cries at the drop of a hat and she doesn't know how to actually speak up for herself. She jumps to a log of conclusions and covers for the wrong people which leads to her getting into a lot of trouble. Also the author really needs to either get Beta Reader to an editor before she releases the next book. I found myself distracted by sentence structure and wording. I could tell that the author was a Brit because even her slang was European. Like the kid Matthew calling his friends "mates" just as an example. There were so many places where words were misspelled or using the European version i.e. "realize" vs. "realise." But I liked it. Something about the story worked for me. I knew who the villain was right off and new what was going to happen at the end but liked how the author got there. She definitely has potential but needs help with structure not making things so obvious and keeping out protagonist from being so whinny. I liked the mystery in the story and how Jake was so 'Caveman' Alpha but in a way that makes you feel as Ana's friend Jessie says every woman would actually want even if it makes her crazy. I would definitely give the sequel a try but again encourage the author to use Beta Readers or pay an editor to work things out a bit more.,3,1984-07-14 05:11:16

374,1059682,242233,I think at this point I'll just stop trying to enjoy Bradbury's writing. The book is short but still it's longer than it needed to be with overabundant over the top descriptions and not enough sense. Believe me I'm all for poetic and metaphor-rich prose but when Catherynne M. Valente does it it's delightful and Ray Bradbury's style is just annoying to me. I did not like that every description of women mentions their breaths including young girls and 4000 year old mummies I actually hated mind-raping Cecy I didn't care for Timothy and the only reason this is not a one star review is Uncle Einar. So in conclusion if you want a story about a human child being raised by the assorted undead read The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman if you're looking for beings created and sustained by human belief take American Gods and if you want something fun with a delightfully morbid gothic family by god go watch The Addams Family.,5,1970-08-22 23:52:51

376,27384500,armanserow,Freddie is fed up with her life she is trying hard to make it as a journalist but has spent three years writing for free and is desperate to find a way to get paid for her work. One day while working a shift at a coffee shop she spots an old friend Nas in amongst a group of people. Freddie finds a way to follow Nas and ends up in the middle of an horrific murder scene. Nas covers for Freddie but she ultimately gets found out though when the murder appears to be linked to twitter Freddie ends up being hired by the police as a social media consultant. The killer tweets as Apollyon. He tweets coded messages and initially only follows one person despite his follower count growing at an incredible rate. The murders were gruesome and made me feel really quite sick. Freddie's shock at each of the crime scenes and the terror she felt each time apollyon tweeted was tangible there were times when I felt like I was right there with her and I could hardly breathe either. I expected this book to be terrifying I was actually a little scared to even start reading it if I'm being completely honest. I've been on social media for years I've shared details of my life on there so the idea of a serial killer finding their next target on twitter sounds so scary. This novel was actually more creepy than terrifying but it really does get under your skin as the tension ramps up. It was very unsettling and unnerving and it does get more scary as it goes along. It's cleverly written because you initially think this would never happen to you because you're careful with what you tweet and then you begin to see how Apollyon is finding his victims and it's insidious how the fear gets to you. None of the characters in this novel were particularly likeable but I don't think characters have to be likeable for a book to be great; it works really well in this novel because it causes you to become suspicious of everyone. I have to admit that I did develop a soft spot for Freddie over the course of the novel; it felt like she was so brash because it was her way of protecting herself and pushing people away but as a result she was often misunderstood which then led to her being more brash. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. I did guess who the murderer was before it was revealed but only a little while before and even then I was doubting myself as there are so many red herrings and twists and turns that it's impossible to be sure about who the killer is. I think I'd suspected just about ever person in this book by the end! I had to keep reminding myself to breath whilst reading the last few chapters it was incredibly tense! This is a good contemporary psychological thriller. Follow Me is due to be published on 3rd December but can be pre-ordered now from Amazon. I received this book from Avon via Net Galley in exchange for an honest review.,3,1962-04-27 23:47:20
377,18338465,altindish,Anyone who has taken even one minute to look into this book knows it's intense it's about sacrifice and it is more than worth your time! It also might have you questioning your morals because I'd be lying if I said I wasn't cheering on Ruthless mob members. There are many characters that weave this story together one of my favorite parts of this novel is that they are easily distinguished not an easy thing to do when there are so many. Carmine the typical bad guy turning over a new leaf for the girl. Haven who has been raised as a slave and cannot fathom the meaning of freedom. Her character development is some of the best I have ever seen written. Dominic easily my favorite character in this series. He lightens it up when it all gets too heavy. Then Vincent I read Made first and it made me very anti Vincent this book only made it worse. Such an intriguing story! I LOVE when I can finish a book and say I have never read anything like that before. So inventive! It did take me until about half way through the book to get on board with Haven and Carmine. I started to really feel it though when she would notice all the little things he did. Such insignificant things that she somehow knew were major from him. Hard to explain but it got me finally feeling all the feels! Definitely left with a lot of unanswered questions which has me anxious to get going onto the next book! "You can play it safe and I wouldn't blame you for it. You can continue as you've been doing and you'll survive but is that what you want? Is that enough?" "some things in life only happen once the memories of them lasting forever. they're moments that alter you turning you into a person you never thought you'd become but someone you were always destined to be.",2,1960-04-30 13:29:31
378,15156124,mirashi99i,I love how quick paced and fresh Zoe's books are. When I need a sure bet paranormal romance I choose one of her books. This book was no exception. The characters are so real they jump from the pages. My one recommendation to new reader's of Zoe's would be to read the first two books in the series first (Blood Lust and Save My Soul) as many past characters make a reappearance in this book. I look forward to starting Life Cycle!,5,1995-07-28 18:00:29

383,22760798,THROTTLE,I was eager to read this novella after reading the other three and so was really happy when I came across it in the library. I was interested to find out what Kalona's life was like before he fell. The book is different from the others in that it gives the history of not just the title character but also that of Nyx Erebus and all of the humans and vampyres. It starts off as a creation tale with energy forming the universe Earth Nyx and Mother Earth. Nyx is the only one of all the Gods and Goddess' to have remained on Earth. She and Mother Earth become firm friends and Mother Earth gifts Nyx with Erebus and Kalona when she becomes lonely. However they were supposed to be one man. It was interesting to see how Nyx made the vampyres but it was annoying that in the end she refers to them as a mistake whose creation should never be mentioned again. I did however really liked the way that the cats became the vampyres familiars through Erebus' gift. The character depicted in this novella are very different to those that appear in the main series Nyx is still young and does not yet possess all of her wisdom and powerful demeanour. Kalona is an annoying character and I much prefer him in the main series even when he is evil his character is better written. It was interesting to get to know Erebus as he is barely mentioned in the main series. He comes across as very nice which makes him a great character but a little uninteresting. Overall I was a little disappointed by this novella although it was still very interesting.,5,1985-12-25 07:33:15
384,15710450,sethpinas,Before this book I didn't know anything about Henri Rousseau. Now that I've read it I'm curious to know more! It was a lovely book with gorgeous paintings the illustrator did a wonderful job portraying his art and yet still making it her own. I loved how the author had real contemporaries of Mr. Rousseau's time and little number guides to show you who was who. I would really like it if this was a new series of children's books about famous painters!,2,1999-03-22 23:43:17

387,18338465,kotek1311,The lovely Paloma convinced me to read this book and she never lets me down. This book was phenomenal. Although my 2015 seems to be filled with mafia books this was hands-down the best of them. This was quite the powerful read. Why drown in love when you can have so much fun swimming in lust? This story starts out with our main protagonist Haven being sold to Dr. DeMarco. Haven is a second generation slave with a very big secret as to who her parents are. She makes her way home with Dr. DeMarco where she finds out he has two sons - Dominic and Carmine. She is treated much fairer in the DeMarco household but Haven is still a slave. Haven made me cry throughout the whole book. Her selflessness mixed with her self preservation just broke me. She was an absolute joy to read about. This book is all about character growth but Carmine's growth was astronomical. He started out such a self-centered teenager and at the end he gave up everything for Haven. My only real complaint is - I didn't really think that Carmine had to join his family's mafia. Sal didn't really do anything to help it was all the Giovanni man. I understand they met by Carmine's visit to Sal to pledge his loyalty in exchange for his help... but it just didn't feel right to me . But that is my only complaint... in a 528 page book. That's pretty impressive in my opinion. This story is about sacrifice and redemption. It will instantly pull you in and you won't want to come up for air. Unique story amazing characters outstanding plot. This book has everything you could possibly want in a book. There was an ache in his chest originating in the center of his heart. It was the pain of all-consuming overflowing love so powerful it took his breath away. "Do you feel this? We belong together." He kissed her. " Sempre.",2,1984-10-29 04:31:58

395,30741810,elenkamadlenka,First off it really didn't take me as long to read this book as the dates might indicate. Because it was in my car handy for those waits when picking up kids from various activities. But once I got it out of my car... This is another series I read out of order (because a friend insisted I read Blonde Ice (see my review of that). This is the first book. And as such Gil Malloy is a bit of a...jerk. He's a down-and-out tabloid reporter. It doesn't get worse than that (well maybe politicians but I digress). What makes it work is you see spots where Malloy isn't a jerk. He could be a nice guy. If he stopped being a smartass. And he's a heck of a reporter. The storyline is clever. A serial killer obsessed with the JKF assassination 50 years ago leaving Kennedy half-dollars as his calling card. A man claiming to be Lee Harvey Oswald's secret son. It's a heck of a story. And buried in the background a simple gang killing. How could it all possibly fit together? Belsky obviously has the reporter's background down and his dialog/description is what you'd consider spot-on for that environment. Malloy is an engaging character (I have the benefit of seeing where he goes from reading book 3 but if you're new to the series you'll see the potential there under the surface). The plotting is tight and the action is snappy. Highly recommended for those looking for a suspense-type read that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.,2,1958-04-27 17:38:22

401,18338465,vasemann,WOW I was completely blown away by this book. I loved it. Like REALLY REALLY loved it. After being on a bit of a mafia binge I was expecting a bit of the same old story but what I got was the perfect balance of "the usual" mafia book traits that I like mixed with an original concept that was addictive intense thought provoking and pretty damn awesome. I was surprised to learn that this book was originally self-published. I can't imagine publishers not jumping straight onto this little gem the moment they read the first pages. It was that good. J.M Darhower has an amazing ability to depict such a brutal world filled with manipulation violence death and darkness whilst also humanising it by allowing the hope love and light shine through. Carmine DeMarco comes from a world of luxury the son of a high ranking mafia member and godson to the leader he wanted for nothing but after witnessing the brutal murder of his mother at 8 years old Carmine is angry he is messed up he is sad and he is lonely. He presents a mask of arrogance nastiness and a bad attitude to the world that lands himself in trouble more often than not. "He never went looking for it but trouble found him at every corner. And Carmine turned ALOT of motherfucking corners." Whilst Haven's life is also completely entangled with the Mafia world her story is very different to Carmine's. Born into a brutal world of slavery every day is constant battle for survival. Beaten starved and abused at the hands of her horrible Masters Haven attempts escape only to be found. After a chance encounter Haven is sold to Carmine's father Vincent. This a beautiful story about two people from totally opposite lives finding themselves and each other. Their worlds may be different but their heartache their fears and their battles are the same. They have the ability to heal and to save each other. "I'm finding myself again because of you. I never thought that would happen. Mom used to talk about fate and I think you're it.... I think you're my fate. You were bought to me for a reason for us to save each other. Because you weren't the only one needing to be saved Haven. I was drowning and you rescued me." Their relationship is simply beautiful. They grow together they learn together and they become more together no labels no divides just who they truly are. "Just because some people see us that way doesn't mean that's all we are. We'll overcome our labels together they don't matter; they don't make us who we are. We make us who we are. Fuck those motherfuckers." The relationship developed beautifully it was such a perfect build up. It progressed so naturally and was born from friendship and trust. Carmine only ever saw Haven as his equal. "Look it's not because I think you belong to me - its because I want you to be mine." They were both damaged and flawed but their love for each other was never one of those flaws. It was true it was honest and it was complete. "Love was him - the beautifully flawed boy who made her glow." "There was an ache in his chest originating in his heart the pain of all consuming overflowing love so powerful it took his breathe away." These two faced so many obstacles this story was filled with emotion pain sacrifice and ultimate love. Whilst you doubt a lot of things throughout the book you never doubt their love for each other or the things they would do to protect it. "Yeah it's me. I told you I'd find you. I was never gonna give up." His voice was fuelled with emotion as he ran his hand along her cheek. "God I fucking love you." Vincent's character was not only pivotal but so intriguing. Just when you thought you had him figured out something would happen and your opinion would change again. He was a broken man who was barely holding on after the death of his wife and the crumbling relationship with his sons particularly Carmine only added to his harsh personality. I enjoyed learning about his motives and seeing that he wasn't a total monster there was a man under his mafia mask. A man that longed to make things right and keep his son free from that world. "You're a good man Vincent and I think sometimes good men find themselves doing bad things." This book was a roller coaster. There was pain joy love suspense action heartache and redemption. It well written fast paced and completely addictive. The story the characters everything. I just couldn't get enough. After learning of Carmine's huge sacrifice to save Haven I am little fearful of what the next book will hold for these two but I have hope they will get the HEA they deserve. "Sempre. No matter what happened next or what went on tomorrow nothing would ever take that away. Their love existed despite everything else and it was that love that would go on forever. The moment was etched in time transcending the constraints put on them life.",4,1989-10-27 02:55:21
402,34311320,oyster33,This may well be considered an epilogue for the "Bludhaven" story line and it was done near perfectly  and for once the art was also good and not the turn off that I have come to accept as part of Nightwing . To be honest  I didn't mind the fate of Defacer  after all I have always wanted Dick-Barbara Canon  anything else doesn't go cool for me  not even Starfire and she's hot* * pun intended This one focussed mainly on how Nightwing and Defacer have both always looked for some relationship to finally anchor them and how relationships can be troublesome . It had a lot of emotional moment and none action-packed ones  so if you are scared to look into your touchy-feely side than you should stay away . Overall another stellar issue for Nightwing and Tim Seeley,4,1976-01-22 11:37:23
403,18338465,littlerosepa,(Buddyreading this book with my lovely sis Eunice) "When love strikes someone like lightning so powerful and intense it can't be denied. It's beautiful and messy cracking a chest open and spilling their soul out for the world to see. It turns a person inside out and there's no going back from it." A 5/5 Sempre Stars for this book! I believe this is one of the best books written so far. Sempre is yet another masterpiece where J.M. Darhower uses a dark theme as a plot device for a YA/NA romantic genre. The story centered around Haven who grew up as a slave under the Antonelli family. She was about to escape and ask for help when she stumbled upon Dr. Vincent DeMarco who brought her to his home and basically gave her shelter. In return she was also to work as his slave-- with restrictions and certain rules to never get out of the house or open any code inside. In her new home she met the notorious bad boy Carmin DeMarco a Mafia prince who has the entire world under his fingertips. What soon blossomed between them was an unexpected love which eventually became a complication to their situation where danger continues to threaten them and heavy decisions matter. I loved the concept of this book and the exquisite romance of two young people who fell in love against seemingly impossible odds. I expected it to be something different something that I'm used to in a Mafia romance but I was surprised by its uniqueness. The writing of J.M. Darhower and the ardent tone she used gave me a plethora of different emotions. She was quiet running her fingers across his abs and tracing his scars with her fingertips. "How about we just be Haven and Carmine? We don't know the ending but we can always hope for the best." "I like that" he said. "Besides there's a reason we don't know how a story ends." "Why?" "Because it doesn't." Carmine and Haven's love story was one of a kind. I absolutely loved their exchange of lines and the way their cheesy yet heart-warming conversations moved me. It also helped a lot that Carmine was such a cocky sarcastic yet very passionate and sweet guy. Just a heads up this guy is extremely jealous and possessive but I admit to myself that I didn't have any problem with him being that way because well who am I to complain? His character was defined so perfectly and I just could't do anything but SWOON. "You were brought to me for a reason for us to save each other. Because you weren't the only one needing to be saved Haven. I was drowning and you rescued me." At first I did have a little problem with the pacing. The book I admit did drag out too long. BUT! I realized when I got to Chapters 40 and beyond that those dragging scenes were a necessity. They were like spices that made the whole book entirely meaningful and dramatic. If the story did not finish with a BOOM and if the story didn't have that beautiful climax then I'd probably resent its slow-pacing but then I loved how the overall story turned out so it didn't become a problem with me. There were many places Carmine would go back to many things he would have done differently but one thing he wouldn't take back was what he had done to save her. As a whole this book was a real surprise. The drama the sentiments the dilemma and even the slow-burn flaw that the author managed to convey were so overwhelming and thought-provoking. I cried a lot of times as I went through its pages (How could an author do that to me?) and I experienced a great deal of adrenaline-rush after reading those action scenes in the near-end. It was just so good!!! To those who love heavy drama and romance with action-packed scenarios you definitely should read this book. I cannot be alone in this guys! I have to get you to read and experience the beauty of this book too! Their love existed despite everything else and it was the love that would go on forever. The moment was etched in time transcending the constraints put on them by life..,5,2000-02-25 11:58:56

405,18068204,lordlion20,Gamers and movie-goers are probably now going to be familiar with mechs and giant robots especially in content from the sf genre. Think Pacific Rim and Transformers or Armoured Core and Zone of Enders. But how many times have you come across giant robots trying to wipe out humanity Terminator style? Well that is exactly what the Rage of the Old Gods is cue the low budget Hollywood straight to free b-movie channel adaptation Wizards vs Robots. Leha is a relatively unknown woman living in an Eastenhold town called Three Gates. She runs an antiques shop and dreams of travelling the world. Her brother Drogin is an engineer and a member of the town's guard tasked with the maintenance of the town's Automatons. Automatons are humanoid shaped machines running on clockwork mechanism powered a magic imbued matrix of silver. Their tranquil suburbia comes under attack from the neighboring empire of Tor who have been quietly amassing a huge army and building new Automatons that are capable of casting spells. Three Gates is quickly crushed and its townsfolk evacuated to Heart the military center of Eastenhold. Desperate to do something to save her fellow countryman from the onslaught of the invading army Leha travels to the capital and dedicates herself into researching an ancient war against the Old Gods that was won by harnessing the power of two other worlds Syom and Tyzu. Soon she works out a way of accessing latent energies to help transport her between worlds and finds herself on the ice planet of Syom which exists within a low energy spectrum and possessing a higher level of gravity to her world of Barria. Failing to find an answer there she is helped by the indigenous 'Ice Creatures' to send her to Tyzu a tropical planet in a higher energy (lower gravity) spectrum then Barria. There she meets a tribe of the Lost Ones and is forced to undergo a transformation at a cellular level that gives her the ability to command her body to adapt to her environment as she wills and the ability to levy the energy spectrum of both Syom and Tyzu. She also makes another discovery that changes the entire nature of the conflict on Barria. The Automatons are the Old Gods vanquished thousands of years ago and unwittingly rebuilt by the humans as weapons of mass destruction. The story is rightly epic in proportion and epic in size too. The pages are full of battles and reflection on the morality of war the fraternal bond of humanity and eminent destruction at the hands of the very things we have made ourselves. The characterization is good and Edwards manages to make the various players in the story come across as emotionally sympathetic beings rather than a list of names. Despite the number of characters and length of the book I hardly struggled at all to remember who they were and what their emotional drivers were. The pacing is a little iffy in places and at times it seems that the author is just as confused as the readers to how much time has expired between scenes. I'm guessing the events of the book transpire over a single year although it really feels more like a couple of years. The scale of the events probably has something to do with this sense of paradox as Leha struggles to unite the known world(s) and organize it into a resistance against the machines. There are structural problems too with the action and the internal reflection happening in separate chunks and some key moments skipped out entirely. The jumps between POV also seemed to happen haphazardly within chapters with apparently no consistent order to the switch between characters. But despite these flaws the author manages to pull together this sprawling epic and kept my interest throughout. Edwards has a lot of maturing to do as a writer and no doubt will bring us many more fine adventures to share in the future. Rage of the Old Gods feels fresh and original and despite the author's lack of experience still is a decent read which earns it an optimistic score of three stars.,1,1978-04-10 16:05:24
406,18338465,fvptdf,I held off on reading this book. It had been recommended to me so many times but I just didn't think it would do it for me. I was completely wrong. This book was exactly what I thought it would be and yet it did not disappoint. Instead it made me keep wanting to turn the page to see what was going to come next. And when it finished it had me wanting to pick up the next one straight away. The characters were well developed and I really enjoyed their growth throughout the story. In fact I even like the accuracy of the human trafficking and the mob. Sure I know that it isn't often that people get their fairytale ending like in this - but it was accurate it did not seek to glorify the life or make it seem like it was something it wasn't. It was true - or at least true as most people will get to this. Either way I can't wait to read Redemption.,2,1982-09-10 13:06:13

408,10803536,bona,I thought the story was excellent - really action packed and different. The science geek in me loved all the weather descriptions and the science behind it. The editor in me though found some of the writing EXTREMELY cheesy. It was so jarring at points it too me out of the story.,5,1988-04-10 15:17:58
409,2093969,nastyaasta,I've read this short book many times ever since I was able to read. My parents read this to me before that. It is a typical fairy tale except not quite because it is by James Thurber. Lots of wordplay and witticisms and silly made-up words too. The illustrations really influenced me more than I had realized until just recently. I just borrowed this from my dad so my kids can read it. I read it out loud to them and they loved it too.,4,2007-05-27 02:41:32
410,32606520,Sugars,I voluntarily reviewed an advanced reader copy of this book. Very good story! Loved the characters and the storyline. Its more of a romance story rather than a bad boy romance. That said it still keeps you on the edge of your seat flipping the pages. Lots of emotions and heat. Would recommend.,5,1957-11-01 16:18:16
411,2093969,ltdtg,Gorgeous language and a quirky at times surreal fairy tale. I'm very glad it's back in print and hope to find an audiobook version soon. It's too perfect not to read aloud.,5,1965-09-30 19:11:23
412,18338465,Ro!,Initial Thoughts: I loved this story as a fan fiction and was excited to hear that it was getting published. This is one of the more original stories out there and the author takes the time to go into a few social issues - slavery and human trafficking. I found that this book was very long with parts lagging. Perhaps a tighter edit would have benefited the pacing. The last third was action packed with bullets flying - crazy. There are some changes from the original fanfic and they worked well. The Review: Disclaimer: I read and loved this book when it was a fan fiction called Emancipation Proclamation. It was so very different from canon and the author highlighted the very real social issues of human trafficking slavery and organized crime. Sempre is a very long story. In fact you could probably call it a family saga. It's a little bit The Godfather mixed in with a lot of teenage angst. Sempre is the story of two teenagers raised in very different circumstances: A mafia prince named Carmine DeMarco and his love interest Haven Antonelli. Haven was raised as a slave living with a mafia family on a remote ranch in California. Until she is "rescued" by Dr. Vincent DeMarco Haven endures all sorts of abuse by her "owners." She is worked to the bone malnourished scarred and has even witnessed the repeated rape of her mother and the murder of another child. When Haven is brought to the DeMarco home in North Carolina she is understandably skittish. It's kind of odd how she arrives as if she is to be their servant. Dr. DeMarco is very cryptic about why Haven has come to live with the family never telling his boys anything about her. Slowly Haven adjusts to life with the DeMarcos cooking and cleaning for the family. She soon attracts the attention of youngest son Carmine even though she is more skittish around him. Carmine is an interesting character. Essentially he is a loose cannon full of anger and rage. Carmine takes teenage angst and brings it to a whole new level. He's loud brash and impulsive. Carmine believes in punching first asking questions later. Carmine wallows in self-destruction and his is constantly at odds with his father. In contrast Carmine's older adopted brother Dominic is his total opposite. Dominic is calm and easy going. Dr. DeMarco's character is very compartmentalized. In North Carolina Dr. DeMarco is a devoted father doctor and respected member of society. When he goes to Chicago on business Dr. DeMarco becomes a totally different person. He holds a high position in the mafia and must follow the instructions of the Don who wants Carmine to join the organization. We do see the darker side to Dr. DeMarco in the North Carolina home and unfortunately Haven bears the brunt of that moment. I liked how the author reworked the original fan fiction. This was not just a replace names with new names there were some editorial changes which helped move the novel along. I did find that the book was very long and at times the pacing was a little slow almost a slog to get through until the last third of the book when the bullets started flying everywhere. I think that this book would benefit from another editorial pass before publication. Sempre would appeal to those who enjoy family sagas and angsty teen romance. I'm looking forward to reading the next book Sempre: Redemption coming out in April 2014. Thank you to Edelweiss and Simon and Schuster for a review copy of this book.

413,23343839,lyaho,OMG! This story is really heating up...on the part 3...,5,1951-12-26 00:57:43
414,2093969,avrtrans,**4.5** This is a beautiful example of how storytelling mastery can breathe completely new life into a stereotypical story. The whole "evil aristocrat with a highly pursued young daughter/niece" is nothing new in any storybook but Thurber's expert use of metaphors language devices and seamlessly slipping into poetry within prose makes this overly-recycled tale irresistible--for children and adults! He doesn't just create personalities for his characters he creates entire atmospheres that surround them through the whole book. I like that Thurber isn't afraid to put a little blood and melancholy in a children's book and there are so many clever lines in this short widely-spaced book that I could enjoy it equally as much after several rereadings. Too bad I have to return it to the friend I'm borrowing it from :(,1,1995-10-31 00:08:24

416,23626289,pyhome,Es war soooo schon und ich heule schon bei dem Gedanken daran dass ich bis Dezember warten muss um zu wissen wie es weitergeht. Jennifer L. Armentrout weiss wirklich wie man mich auf die Folter spannt.,5,1983-05-10 18:19:10
417,23626289,onelonewolf,Worum geht's? Auf den ersten Blick ist alles perfekt: Dawson lebt noch und niemand scheint nach ihm zu suchen. Katy wehrt sich nicht langer gegen ihre Gefuhle fur Daemon und alles konnte so schon sein - aber es ist nur die Ruhe vor dem Sturm. Plotzlich ist Blake zuruck und mit ihm ein gewagter Plan. Zu Katys grossem Erstaunen bittet er sie um Hilfe. Katy weiss nicht was sie tun soll denn Blake ist nicht zu trauen das hat sie schon einmal schmerzlich zu spuren bekommen. Doch fur ihre Freunde - und fur Daemon - wurde sie alles tun. Selbst ihr eigenes Leben aufs Spiel setzen. Meine Meinung Der erste Teil war grandios und einfach was vollig neues. Der zweite Teil hat im Vergleich dann leider stark nachgelassen weil es zumindest mir viel zu viel Hin-und-Her zwischen unseren beiden lieben Protagonisten war. Das Niveau des zweiten Bandes hat Opal errreicht aber wirklich begeistern konnte mich das Buch nicht was aber vor allem an den Personen bzw. deren Entwicklung und der sich wiederholenden Handlung lag (mehr dazu unten). Erstmal das offensichtlich Positive: Das Cover ist wie schon bei den Vorgangern einfach traumhaft schon *-* Da hat sich Carlsen wieder mal wirklich Muhe gegeben und die Reihe sieht im Bucherregal einfach toll aus :D Katy. Ich muss wirklich zugeben dass ich seit einiger Zeit so meine Probleme mit ihr habe. Okay in Band 1 war sie mir wirklich sympathisch vor allem weil sie nicht auf den Mund gefallen ist und immer ausspricht was sie denkt. Umso mehr hatte ich dann in "Onyx" meine Probleme mit ihr. Ihr standiges Er-liebt-mich-ja-eigentlich-doch-nicht-sondern-nur-wegen-dieser-Alienbindung-Gejammere im Bezug auf Daemon hat mich in den Wahnsinn getrieben und die Sympathiepunkte sind in den Keller gesackt. Zumindest das hat sich hier geandert. Sie hat sich weiterentwickelt ist starker und vor allem selbstbewusster geworden. Und sie lernt langsam mit ihren neuen Kraften umzugehen. Leider leider fand ich sie aus irgendeinem Grund nicht mehr so ansprechend wie zu anfangs in "Obsidian" vielleicht liegt es daran dass sie mir einfach alles zu...perfekt kann oder dass ich das Gefuhl hatte das bloggende sympathische Madchen ist hier vollstandig hinter seinem alles-konnenden Alien-Mutanten-Alter-Ego zuruckgeblieben. Nach den ersten Kapitel ging es noch aber wenn dann mal wieder alle davon reden wie "besonders" Katy doch ist und sie sich selbst fur etwas aussergewohnliches halt hatte ich ihr den Hals umdrehen konnen... Und ich hab regelrecht gemerkt wie sie mir eigentlich immer gleichgultiger geworden ist und ich nicht mit ihr mitgelitten habe schade eigentlich. Da Katy in diesem Teil nicht wirklich uberzeugend war habe ich meine Hoffnungen auf Daemon gesetzt. Man kennt ihn ja als selbstbewussten sarkastischen jungen Mann allerdings wird schnell klar dass er sich hier geander hat. Dadurch dass er nun mit Katy zusammen ist ist er viel zartlicher und offener geworden (zumindest ihr gegenuber) das hatte suss sein konnen leider haben dadurch aber auch ihre Streitgesprache die mich fruher immer zum Lachen gebracht haben deutlich an Biss verloren. Trotz allem liebe Daemon einfach er ist wirklich ein Traumtyp. Er ist witzig zartlich ernst und beschutzt diejenigen die ihm wichtig sind. Seiner Familie gegenuber ist er noch immer sehr beschutzend und es hat mich echt mitgenommen wie sehr es ihm zu schaffen macht dass Dawson sich anders benimmt als fruher. Zu Meckern gabe es vielleicht dass er manchmal einfach "zu weich" ruberkam und dadurch irgendwie seinen Charakter einbusste was ich hier sehr schade fand da ich mir ofter den Daemon gewunscht hatte den man im ersten Band kennengelernt hat. Dee und Dawson sind zwei super Nebencharaktere auch wenn mich Dee in diesem Teil oft genervt hat. Klar sie tat mir total leid wegen dem was mit Adam passiert ist aber mich hat es trotzdem irgendwann zur Weissglut getrieben wie mies sie Katy behandelt hat. Dawson war fur mich mit Abstand der interessanteste Charakter und der Grund wieso das Buch dann doch noch annehmbar war. Ziemlich schnell wird klar dass er sich durch seine Zeit in der er in den Handen des VM war ziemlich verandert hat und ich wollte einfach nur wissen was ihm in der Zeit schreckliches widerfahren ist. Zudem war seine Verbindung und seine Liebe zu Beth wirklich bittersuss mitzuerleben weil er (genau wie sein Bruder) einfach alles fur seine Liebste tun wurde. Und jetzt zu Blake. Ich habe selten einen Buchcharakter so sehr gehasst wie ihn. Und obwohl die Autorin das sicherlich auch so wollte habe ich die Szenen mit ihm immer mit einem unguten Gefuhl gelesen. Man kann ihm einfach nicht verzeihen was Daemons Famile seinetwegen durchmachen musste und als er dann auch noch mit einem unmoralischen Angebot daherkommt war er fur mich vollig auf der Abschussliste... Allerdings muss ich sagen dass er - nachdem ich von Katy und Daemon jetzt nicht sooo begeistert war - wirklich eine Bereicherung fur das Buch gewesen ist. Man hat ihn gehasst - aber er hat Spannung ins Buch gebracht. Armentrouts Schreibstil ist wie immer: humorvoll spannend und gleichzeitig sehr von Gefuhlen durchsetzt sodass man sich perfekt in die Geschichte einfuhlen kann. Die Spannung hat hier und da mal eine Flaute dafur hat dieses Buch ein WIRKLICH fieses Ende. Ich sterbe wenn ich nicht sofort den funften Teil bekomme... Ich liebe die Bucher der Autorin einfach (wenn inzwischen auch mehr die Dark Elements-Trilogie als diese Reihe hier) und bis "Opposition" dann im Dezember auf Deutsch erscheint kann man sich daruber hinwegtrosten dass bereits im August der zweite Teil ihrer YA-Reihe "Dark Elements - Eiskalte Sehnsucht" erscheint ;) Ich kann's auf jeden Fall kaum mehr erwarten. Zum Schluss muss ich allerdings nochmals meine Kritik anbringen: und zwar waren Daemon und Katy zwar wirklich suss miteinander aber leider ging dadurch auch grosstenteils der Biss der Dialoge verloren der die Vorgangerbande so besonders gemacht hat und die Story platscherte teilweise etwas vor sich hin bzw. bestimmte Passagen wiederholten sich immer wieder (z.B. das Training). Ausserdem nervte mich Katy irgendwie allerdings hab ich keine Ahnung wieso :D Im ersten Teil mochte ich sie wirklich aber seit "Onyx" stehe ich mit ihr etwas auf Kriegsfuss... Was auch der Grund ist wieso ich diesen Teil nicht wirklich gut fand. Was Katy und Daemon verlieren schaffen allerdings die Nebenpersonen aufzuholen vor allem Dawson war mein Liebling in diesem Teil. Leider bringen die Personen auch nicht mehr viel wenn es an der Story und den Hauptcharakteren schwachelt. Fazit Ein dritter Band der leider nicht ganz mit den Vorgangern mithalten konnte. Die Liebesgeschichte hat sich zwar von einer "harmlosen" Schwarmerei zu einer Beziehung entwickelt in der Katy und Daemon wirklich alles fureinander tun wurden. Leider ist dadurch aber auch ein Teil des Wortwitzes und der Spannung verloren gegangen. Schade. Trotzdem freue ich mich auf den nachsten Teil und bin gespannt wie es mit Katy und ihren Freunden weitergeht. 35/5 Sternchen,5,2013-01-10 19:02:14
418,2093969,cpuser,"Once upon a time in a gloomy castle on a lonely hill where there were thirteen clocks that wouldn't go there lived a cold aggressive Duke and his niece the Princess Saralinda. She was warm in every wind and weather but he was always cold. His hands were as cold as his smile and almost as cold as his heart. He wore gloves when he was asleep and he wore gloves when he was awake which made it difficult for him to pick up pins or coins or the kernels of nuts or to tear the wings from nightingales." The Duke was good at designing terrible torments for the princes who sought Saralinda's hand and he liked feeding people to his geese.The Thirteen Clocks is filled with magic and absurdity swordplay and wordplay. Some people like author Neil Gaiman think it is the best book in the world and makes people happy like ice cream. It has a prince and a princess. It has a cold-hearted villain who admits "We all have flaws; mine is being wicked. It has a woman who weeps jewels. There are spies and an unkillable monster the terrible Todal made of entirely of lip that feels as if it has been dead a dozen days and moves about like monkeys and shadows. Thurber wrote The Thirteen Clocks and though he was crazy as no one had ever written anything like it. It turns out it spawned a sub-genre: the fractured fairytale and was hugely influential helping to inspire Shrek the Princess Bride and eventually the Stinky Chees Man.,2,2005-03-06 00:53:19
419,27036538,rex5067,Well this was the first volume of the entire Crossed series I just couldn't get into at all and the sad thing is I don't think it was even the story itself that was the problem. This series is set 100 years after the Crossed outbreak and the English language is broken. So basically you have to slog through a bunch of words that make no sense in order to piece the story together. To make things worse there's a TON of words in here. Tons of dialogue and description just a very wordy comic. From what I could gather the story wasn't bad at its core. We have a group of Crossed confronting a town of uninfected and there's a battle and some double crossing. Also a hot air balloon and a guy that looked like Santa Claus. The main character from the first volume is still around but this volume was just too confusing. The art was still top notch and there's only one volume of this series left so I'll slog through the final one since it's literally the only Crossed volume I haven't read.,2,2011-03-17 02:13:53
420,27036537,sept77,This volume was written and illustrated by Mike Wolfer who I remember from the underrated Widow series. He's known for his "bad girl" art so the art in this volume was sexy but since this is Crossed there's plenty of gore as well. This once again continues the whole "uninfected humans can be the most evil" theme but in this case it's more of a morality tale ala the old EC comics such as Tales From The Crypt. Two sexy women show up and begin to manipulate a group using a survival handbook based on the Zombie Attack manuals from Max Brooks. Another good volume but I'm still disliking the lack of "good guys" in the series.,4,1987-05-29 14:48:25

422,3882435,petrchalup,When ever I read a Ray Bradbury book I'm always glad I did! You can tell he has fun with what he does. The way that he thinks about things and words it is ingenious and creative! It's like he kept that endearing child-like quality that most people loose along the way and he puts it into his writing to make our brains happy. And yes I know he's not of this world anymore and I'm using present tense. But obviously he lives on through his writing. :^) This book is home to 2 short stories: Somewhere a Band is Playing and Leviathan '99. The former is about a Journalist who visits a town unlike most. The latter is a spaced out version of Moby Dick. I was more drawn into the 1st one but both are good. And now for the masterfully written poem from chapter 2 in Somewhere a Band is Playing. "Somewhere a band is playing Playing the strangest tunes Of sunflower seeds and sailors Somewhere a drummer simmers And trembles with times forlorn Remembering days of summer In futures yet unborn. Futures so far they are ancient And filled with Egyptian dust That smell of the tomb and the lilac And seed that is spent from lust And peach that is hung on a tree branch Far out in the sky from one's reach There mummies as lovely as lobsters Remember old futures and teach. And children sit by on the stone floor And draw out their lives in the sands Remembering deaths that wont happen In futures unseen in far lands. Somewhere a band is playing Where the moon never sets in the sky And nobody sleeps in the summer And nobody puts down to die; And Time then just goes on forever And hearts then continue to beat To the sound of the old moon-drum drumming And the glide of Eternity's feet; Somewhere the old people wander And linger themselves into noon And sleep in the wheat fields yonder To rise as fresh children with moon. Somewhere the children old maunder And know what it is to be dead And turn in their weeping to ponder Oblivious filed 'neath their bed. And sit at the long dining table Where life makes a banquet flesh Where dis-able makes itself able And spoiled puts on new masks of fresh. Somewhere a band is playing Oh listen oh listen that tune! If you learn it you'll dance on forever In June... And yet June... And more...June... And Death will be dumb and not clever And Death will lie silent forever In June and June and more June." Need I say more? :^),1,1971-02-08 21:36:04
423,36242939,jelannayatebe,'Waterboarding' is the second novel by 'Bragadeesh Prasanna' and is released a few days ago in India. How your memory shapes your personality and identity? Is a man remain internally the same even after by some strange twist of fate his memory gets restructured and sometimes fabricated? These are some of the questions the latest novel by Prasanna ask and explore. A bike accident and the protagonist loses parts of his memory he starts facing difficulties in recognizing people who seem to hold him quite close. From here the story goes back and forth in time to show us the same person in different memory-conditions. The hated person becomes the loved one the closest person becomes utterly irritating. Ved falls in love with Maya but doesn't show it to the world. Sara becomes possessive of Ved and complications start from there. The characters question themselves continuously about their feelings for the other person and in this way  the author effortlessly pulls off different aspects of every character. More than knowing others this novel is about knowing the self and the permutations of memory segments are cleverly used to achieve just that. The story is told through different perspectives of the characters  resulting in a multiple first person POV narrative. Though the narrative is dialogue-heavy this doesn't pose any problem in the crisp descriptions of the surroundings. The language is sleek clear and minimal which I love and encourage among my writer friends. Theseus had posed an interesting paradox: if every part of a ship is replaced by an exact replica then would the resulting ship be any different from the initial one? This question is extended to the protagonist in this novel. If memory of a person is replaced piece by piece with new or modified ones then would the person remain same? Role of our memory is a much discussed topic among the greats and this book tries to throw light on the same from a different angle. When you have to depend on others for your own memory there is always a chance of misinterpretation or modification. And while going though that process sometimes you discover aspects of your own self you never imagined existed. This novel ultimately boils down to that and more. This is promising novel from a writer I look forward to and I hope he keeps producing more novels like this in future.,1,2007-03-05 18:31:22

426,32606520,skipar,This was the first book I have read by Jess Bentley and it wouldn't be my last that's for sure! Bucked was fast paced and kept me interested from the start! Kanen and Charity had a depth to them that I wasn't expecting! Kanen is part native American and there is an element of racism that he experiences as we read that is really well written. He has demons from his past and it's Chastity that brings a calm he hasn't been lucky enough to experience before. Chastity brings her own emotional baggage though making these two more of an unlikely pair that just ends up working really well in this fast paced book. I'm not usually down for the cowboy genre but this was a great quick read that was from a different angle with the bull riding side of things that comes with Kanen. If you are looking for something different that's easy on the eyes and leaves you feeling a little more positive than when you started then this one is the one for you! 4 bucking stars for this baby,5,1977-12-22 06:45:56

His skin was warm to the touch and she could slightly feel his pulse pounding against her palm. "Do you feel that? I'm not going anywhere Haven. This is yours." I mean am I supposed to just go on after reading this thing?! I know there are many reviews with the plot on here so I won't even go into it but I just desperately needed to express my love for this story. What perfect emotional heartbreaking soul crushing sweet sad incredible story. I literally had goose bumps the entire time and was left with no fingernails after biting them all off from the suspense. This story is so insane and all the characters are so entwined I wouldn't even know where to start to go into details about the story line even if I wanted to. And what is most amazing about it is the simple way it's written. To me it read so well each scene played out like a movie in my mind. If this was a movie I would have watched it 7356 times already. "I love you." The words tumbled from her lips easily like they had rolled from her tongue hundreds of times. But they hadn't. She had never said them before but as she heard them in her own voice every cell in her body knew they were true. She hadn't known what love was but she knew it now. Love was the fluttering in her tummy whenever Carmine was near the twinkle in his eyes when he laughed the heat in her body from his words. Love was happy. Love was safe. Love was green. Love was him--the beautifully flawed boy who made her glow." I will say this- Vincent- God at first I hated him and could not understand the man for the life of me. But as the story unfolded I definitely understood and grew to love him. Especially at the end when he finally accepts the past and accepts Haven and actually addresses her by her name. GODDDDDD SO SWEET. Celia and Corrado are freaking amazing Dominic is a sweet heart who I wished was my relative. And the best for last - Carmine and Haven -SIGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. I mean could a smart ass impatient foul-mouthed little rebel be any more amazing??! And Haven oh sweet Haven. What an amazing strong sweet person she was. Their love was just epic. "I have a problem with my temper. It's just I feel . . ." He hesitated taking a deep breath. "Look it's not because I think you belong to me--it's because I want you to be mine." This is easily one of the most incredible books I have ever read. Definitely in my top favorites of all time. *UPDATE* MOST DEFINITELY MY MOST FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME. Now- I have wasted enough time writing this and wasted precious moments not reading Sempre: Redemption. I am off to meet with my sweet Carmine once again.

437,32606520,rre7325,Chastity was a young widow mourning the tragic loss of her husband and unborn child both lost in a car accident . She moved from Canada to Texas to start her life again. That's when she met the best rodeo bull rider in Texas Kaenan aka The Wrecker. Kaenan was a real Texas cowboy and lived for the hard core action of the rodeo. When the two met sparks flew. He was drawn to Chastity and intrigued when she didn't chase after him like most women around town. There was something different about her. She didn't want him for his money. The story developed from there as the two became lovers on their first official date. He took her to his favorite spot in the world for a picnic. The romantic setting paired with the bottle of Dom allowed Chastity to lower her inhibitions and she gave herself to him. It was on from there. Drama ensued when a rude customer at the restaurant Chas was working made some painful racist comments about Kaenan's Native American heritage. The evil man tried to have Chas deported and attempted to kill Kaenan. Things worked out and they got the HEA they were searching for. The story was cute. I wanted so badly to fall for Kaenan but there was no sparkle. I also found Chas a little annoying but not enough to dislike her.,5,2017-04-29 14:13:27

442,13505910,balajee,Brought to you by OBS reviewer Dawn I didn't like Eternal Shadows at first. I began to enjoy it about half way through. Initially I thought Kassandra (the main character) was one dimensional just a whiny brat. And to be honest it was annoying. I nearly gave up but something compelled me to give it another go. I'm glad I stuck with it. Kassandra began to redeem herself as I saw glimpses of a fighting spirit. She was always pushing back. Kassandra questioned everything wanting to learn. And she was willing to sacrifice herself for the people she loved. Most of the secondary characters are fleshed out. Madge and Millie stand out sisters who are polar opposites. I especially enjoyed Aurelia who has been around a long time. She is just a bad ass vampire. I love that everyone can "feel" when an older vampire enters the room. The idea of a blended family of vampires each with their own position and responsibilities was interesting. Each family member came from a different time in history giving the reader a different perspective as they weigh in on decisions. The chapters have very clever names. My favorite: "When In Rome". The only problem I had with the book is the relationship between Kassandra and Rhys. I could not understand what he saw in Kassandra and I still don't. The question was brought up in the book but it wasn't answered to my satisfaction. That said I loved the idea of separation through death and reincarnation. I also enjoyed the idea that vampires can't be reincarnated or can they? I recommend Eternal Shadows as an interesting read. http://openbooksociety.com/article/et...,5,1967-09-26 00:34:08

457,15710450,scrboy,The life and art of French artist Henri Rousseau are vividly brought to life in a recent release by author Michelle Markel and illustrator Amanda Hall. Rousseau is best known for his post-impressionist paintings depicting jungle scenes although he never left France. Rousseau we learn from Markel's succinct yet poetic text wants to be an artist even though he is 40 years old a toll collector and has never had any art training. "Why? Because he loves nature. Because when he strolls through the parks of Paris it's like the flowers open their hearts the trees spread their arms and the sun is a blushing ruby all for him." With no money for art lessons Rousseau studies the paintings at the Louvre photographs illustrations animals at the zoo and leaves plants and flowers from the local botanical garden where he is particularly enraptured by the tropical plants. Although his work is ridiculed by the art critics Henri perseveres spending all his money on art supplies and supplementing his income by giving music lessons. Although the art establishment continues to belittle his work several younger artists including the already well-known Picasso eventually recognize his talent. Now of course his paintings are in museums world-wide and he is recognized as an artistic genius. The illustrations by Amanda Hall pay tribute to Rousseau's "primitive" style with its flattened shapes vivid colors detailed leaves and plants and unusual perspective. Many of the illustrations draw directly on Rousseau's paintings for inspiration and adults will recognize some of his most famous works such as "Sleeping Gypsy." Even the endpapers echo Rousseau's easily recognizable style with its jungle leaves flowers and animals. To better emulate the feel of Rousseau's paintings Hall worked in watercolor and acrylics. She also incorporates some of his famous friends into her illustrations and in the afterword a key is provided to see who is who in those spreads. I would have liked to see some reproductions of Rousseau's actual paintings in the afterword but these can easily be found online for those who would like to explore further the fascinating works of this self-taught artist.,1,2015-03-03 01:39:50

459,10803536,killer26794,I won this book through the Goodreads First Reads Giveaway on 07/15/2011! I was really excited to read this book. The idea that someone or something can control the weather sounded really interesting and the possibilities seemed endless with how this book would work out. Let me tell you the beginning of the book was hairy. I had to really push through it. There was a lot of background info and scientific stuff that I'm usually into but it was just too much. Once you get to the meat of the story it was pretty good. I think that it could have been pushed a little further and explored a few more avenues - in my mind. That's the thing with book reviews. They are all subjective. Each person is going to have a different view on how it should have gone and not everyone is going to be completely happy. Anyway it was just okay. I don't think that it turned out to be the earth-shattering book that I thought it would but I might read it again. Maybe I'm just no science-y enough to fully appreciate it.,1,2000-12-02 03:46:47

468,23626289,rfvtgb1234,Hach! Der dritte Band der funfteiligen Reihe von Jennifer L. Armentrout ist jetzt auch bei mir eingezogen und in einem Tag und ein bisschen mehr ausgelesen worden....ich bin stolz auf mich:-) Du meinst dass du mich von Anfang an unglaublich sexy fandst und den Blick nicht von mir lassen konntest." Wir mussen dringend an deiner Bescheidenheit arbeiten." (...) Aber o Mann du hast mich vielleicht wahnsinnig gemacht." Das Cover Das Cover ist mal wieder der absolute Wahnsinn! Diesmal in blauer Tonung. Und ich finde dass die Bucher nebeneinander total awesome aussehen! Auch das vierte und funfte werden hoffentlich grandios! Das Cover vom vierten ist ubrigens schon raus. Guckt es euch doch mal an (Ich glaube dass ihr es selber schafft nach Obsidian Band 4" zu googeln. Da muss ich nix mehr verlinken) Die Story Jaja die Story....man merkt leider auch hier dass es nur ein Ubergangsband zum vierten und funften Buch ist. Damit will ich nicht sagen dass das Buch schlecht war. Auf keinen Fall! Aber die Story hatte man auch locker in hundert Seiten abhandeln konnen. SPOILER: Ich finde es sehr komisch dass der Aufhanger der gesamten Story ist dass man resistent gegen den Onyx werden muss...das kommt mir irgendwie zu einfach vor. Allerdings finde ich dass die Figuren und deren Beziehungen zueinander sehr gut weiterentwickelt wurden und naturlich die Neueinfuhrung eines Charakters *hust* Luc *hust* hat mir sehr zugesagt. Manche Ereignisse waren auch echt unvorhersehbar obwohl das grosse Ganze die ganze Zeit schon ersichtlich war aber die Intrigen und Lugen die hier gesponnen werden sind sehr spannend. Aber dieser mieeeeese Cliffhanger.....musste das sein?! Da wird man die ganze Zeit auf das gross Finale des Buches hingefuhrt und angefixt und dann passiert SOWAS?! Das kann doch nicht euer Ernst sein! Ich will den vierten Band. JETZT! Die Hauptperson Hach ja...Katy. Was mich in diesem Bnd wirklich verblufft hat ist ihre wahnsinnige Entwicklung von ihr denn sie hat sich wirklich vom schuchternen und unsicheren Madchen zu einer starken jungen Frau entwickelt. Allerdings hat sie immer noch Gewissensbisse bei bestimmten Dingen und da wird wunderbar dargestellt dass sie sich immer noch ein bisschen dagegen wehrt und im Kern wie Daemon es so schon ausgedruckt hat immer gut war und immer gut bleiben wird. Ihre Krafte sind ubrigens noch starker geworden und man merkt dass sie endlich einigermassen akzeptiert wird und ebenfalls auf gleicher Stufe mit ihnen" mithalten kann. Die Beziehung von Daemon und Katy Auch hier gibt es eine immense Entwicklung denn von der Hassliebe bei der sich beide nicht eingestehen wollten dass sie sich mogen andert es sich in eine Beziehung die liebevoller nicht hatte sein konnen. Zwar geht eine Menge von der heissen Stimmung zwischen den beiden floten aber trotzdem ist ihre Beziehung und ihre neue tiefe Verbundenheit sehr gut zu spuren. Die beiden sind einfach der Hammer und funktionieren auch in brenzligen Situationen sehr gut. (Auch wenn Daemon ein wenig zuuuu fursorglich ist. Aber nur ein bisschen. :-P) Die Beziehungen untereinander Vor allem Katys und Dawsons Beziehung hat mir sehr gut gefallen. Aber auch das Auseinanderleben von Dee und Katy und das anschliessende wieder aneinander annahern. Katys Mutter ist wie immer der Wahnsinn und verschiedene Nebencharaktere erleben krasse Wendungen oder entpuppen sich als etwas ganz anderes. In diesem Buch liegt der Fokus ganz klar auf den Beziehungen untereinander und Katys innerem Konflikt. Der Schreibstil Jennifer L. Armentrout kann einfach sehr gut schreiben. Das ist einfach so. Punkt. Aus. Ende. Und obwohl ich mein Lesetempo warum auch immer (ich habe wirklich keine Ahnung) sehr heruntergeschraubt habe konnte ich das Buch nicht aus der Hand legen. Und wenn doch habe ich nach spatestens 10 Minuten wieder zugegriffen. Der Schreibstil lasst sich auch lange Sicht ertragen. Und das ist keines Falls negativ gemeint denn es gibt Schreibstile bei denen man hochstens 50-100 Seiten lesen kann bevor man die Bucher weglegen muss. Kurzum: Bucher die sich nicht in Einem weg lesen lassen. Dieses Buch gehort nicht dazu. Das hier kann man problemlos in einem Rutsch durchlesen. Fazit Ein Fortsetzungsband bei dem man merkt dass er auf die nachsten Bande hinleitet und dafur an Story einbussen musste aber an Charakterweiterentwicklungen und zwischencharakterlichen Beschreibungen zugelegt hat um den Grundstein fur die Folgebande zu legen. Dafur gibt es von mir 4 von 5 Tintenklecksen.,2,1981-05-28 22:23:24
469,2093969,blefiz1723,This book is utterly delightful--short sweet and chock full of delicious details. There is a brave prince. There is a beautiful princess. There is an evil Duke who wears both a monocle and an eye patch. There is a woman who weeps jewels a flock of man-eating geese and a spine-chilling something that "punish[es] evildoers for having done less evil than they should." There are spies. There are quests. And there is a one-of-a-kind Golux about whom it is impossible to say more without depriving readers of the joy of the discovering him for themselves. As if all this wondrous detail weren't enough the story is told in delightful lyrical prose that positively tingles on the tongue. While I'm sure the print version is thoroughly enjoyable the ably-narrated audiobook version allows the reader to savor the sounds of the words. In fact I suspect that if I'd read the print version I would constantly have to fight the urge to read passages aloud simply to taste the words--to feel them on my tongue and hear them tinkle like whimsical bells in my ears. Thurber is clearly an extremely skilled writer with a deft touch an appreciation for the ridiculous and a flair for wordplay. I very much look forward to reading his other works. I will leave you with the words of the inimitable Neil Gaimain who described the book far better than I ever could in his introduction to the 2008 hardcover edition: I read [this book] when I was about eight. I was fairly certain it was the best book I had ever read. It was funny in strange ways. It was filled with words. And while all books are filled with words this one was different: it was filled with magical wonderful tasty words. [...] It is short--not too short just perfectly short. [...] I watch Thurber wrap his story tightly in words while at the same time juggling fabulous words that glitter and gleam tossing them out like a happy madman all the time explaining and revealing and baffling with words. It is a miracle. Works for me.,4,1998-01-22 01:58:23
470,27036536,nessco,Ennis keeps delivering well-researched and gritty tales of war but it's disappointing he wasn't able to draw on the same calibre of artists he had on the original Vertigo run. In this volume the art is merely serviceable and sometimes even plain subpar. A rather significant contrast to what we've seen previously. However I really did love the detour from the restricting WW II template of the predecessors - a trip to 1973 Israel for a story about the Yom Kippur War. Not entirely sure if I'll continue with the fourth volume since Tomas Aira (who provides the weakest artwork in this) is the sole artist in that one. Really not a fan of his. Damn shame but hell we've had a bloody - pun intended - good run.,1,1981-10-04 02:38:16
471,25930498,pokrovskywx,I don't think I am enough of an intellectual to truly appreciate this book. I thought some of the philosophical ideas were promising (e.g. how easy it would be to undermine a two-party political system the potential for social change to swing back towards a patriarchal and religious focus if only by sheer force of population numbers) but found their execution almost unbearably tedious. I might have been more engaged had there been some more significant female characters. I found it difficult to believe that all of the female members of a contemporary French society would actually concede so quietly to the social domestic and sexual submission contemplated by the novel. Francois does not engage in active dialogue with any woman properly affected by this as Myriam moves away and his lecturer friend is reduced to cooking multi-course dinners before disappearing from the narrative at the critical moment even though her husband sticks around to discuss politics with Francois. Subsequent to this the only female characters seem to be giggling school girl types or dumpy housewives. Perhaps this was some kind of device to illustrate the overall submission theme of the novel but I found it too far fetched to credit. Even though I was interested by some of his ideas overall I was bored by Francois' self-indulgent introspection which never really seemed to get down to the fundamental question of whether he could move his personal belief system from atheism to true Islamic belief. Rather in the end it seemed to decline to a consideration of whether he would find the spouse of an arranged marriage sexually attractive and how many wives he would be able to have. I can't help but feel that Francois' character development was intended to make some kind of deeply intellectual point but whatever it is I'm clearly not clever enough to understand it. There simply wasn't enough plot around the political and philosophical discussion to maintain my interest.,3,2017-12-18 20:01:56

476,1059682,rivate4533,I read an interview with Ray Bradbury not so long ago where he was talking about re-reading one of his own older books (Dandelion Wine I think) and he said he realized that he was never going to write anything that good again - he was amazed that he had written it. It was one of the saddest things from an author that I've heard... Unfortunately reading this more recent book (2001) I see what he means. The book is not without its charms - but parts of it were initially written in the 1940's others at other times and it has a cobbled-together sort of feeling. In the past Bradbury has masterfully put together short stories to create a novel (The Martian Chronicles for example one of my favorite books) but this book just didn't convince me. Which is too bad because I really like the theme - a mystical Addams-family type group of weird characters with strange and occult talents living semi-secretly among us regular humans... The note by Bradbury is interesting talking about how he and Addams developed these similar ideas separately but had talked about doing an illustrated book together - the project never came to fruition but one of Addams' pictures is the cover art for this book. I wish they had done it when they first talked about it.,4,1982-10-17 00:40:20
477,15710450,sepehrair,So while the words of this book are biographical the illustrations are a clear presentation of Rousseau's style. Hall did a remarkable job of keeping consistent with this stylistic mimicry while inventing scenes that were her own. Like so many modern artist biographies this one emphasizes the narrative of 'artist persists despite critical rejection' (along with 'he died poor and not so famous'). I'm not sure what to make of that narrative today--why is it the accepted story of an artist's life?,1,1958-04-25 12:24:49

479,23626289,katyabumerang,first read: April 26 2015 rating: 4 stars re-read: May 1 2016 rating: 3 stars So Opal is the typical middle book in a book series: nothing really happens. First of all I'm still not a fan of the relationship between Katy and Daemon. If you read my previous reviews you already know that. I just can't feel their love for each. On top their characters did not develop in a good direction. Katy who was fierce and stood her ground whenever Daemon humiliated her is gone. She went through a lot yes but her whiny behaviour and her jealousy because of Ash was just too much. Just get your shit together please. And Daemon was too overprotective and possessive again. Further we have the other characters. I don't really want to write something about Dee. Her "turn" was just too much for me. I liked her a lot but this girl ... let's not talk about her. And Dawson is a boy who just acts first and then thinks. And Blake .... ugh I hate him. As mentioned before nothing really happened. Dawson is back devasted because of Beth wants er back for all costs. And Blake comes back yuhu. There some exciting moments that weren't that exciting sadly. And they learn of the meaning of "Opal". That's it. The only really thrilling moment was the ending althoug I wasn't that surprised how the book ends. 3 stars,5,2009-04-07 07:05:57
480,23626289,dgemails,Dass mir dieser Band weniger gefallen hat als seine beiden Vorganger liegt wahrscheinlich an der Mischung daraus dass YA mich nicht mehr so begeistert wie vor 2 Jahren (wo ich die ersten Bande geradezu verschlungen habe) und andererseits dieser Band auch im Allgemeinen weniger Action und Plotentwicklung vorzuweisen hatte. Ich habe es durchaus genossen dass Katy und Daemon endlich zusammen sind statt umeinander herumzutanzen. Aber irgendwann wollte ich einfach nur noch schreien: Habt endlich Sex damit dieses gegenseitige Bespringen aufhort und wir echte Spannung und Handlung bekommen! Gerade der Mittelteil zog sich leider es passierte kaum etwas was den Handlungsbogen entscheidend voran brachte. Enttauscht war ich davon wie hochgradig pubertar Dee sich verhalt. Und Katys standiger Zwang bei jeder gefahrlichen Aktion mit von der Partie sein zu mussen verursachte bei mir Augenrollen. Da war dieses Ende das einen absolut scheusslichen Cliffhanger hatte absolut absehbar. Ich habe dahingehend mal wieder Probleme mit der Glaubwurdigkeit: vier Teenager dringen nun mal nicht einfach so in eine gut gesicherte Militarbasis ein selbst wenn sie Aliens und Hybriden sind. Katy und Daemon sind und bleiben die geliebten und mir sehr sympathischen Protagonisten welche diese Reihe ausmachen und mir als Paar sehr gut gefallen aber die Mischung aus Teeniehormonen und Highschool-Feeling die die Reihe noch immer hat passen nicht mehr so recht zu mir. Sicherlich werde ich die Reihe irgendwann trotzdem weiter verfolgen. Nur nicht gerade jetzt denn ich habe erstmal wieder genug.,2,1955-09-22 11:06:25
481,18338465,mraupp,3.5 stars There are some 500-page books that I can fly through reading and they don't seem very long at all. Sempre isn't one of them. I felt every single one of the 528 pages. It felt very much like it's 528 pages long. The mafia human trafficking sacrifice vengeance and forbidden young love are themes that kept me interested. However the plot unfolds extremely slowly and is bogged down with more repetitive details than necessary. At times it seems like the reader is experiencing life in the DeMarco household not just day to day but hour by hour. The story could be told in much less time and still be impactful. Although I found the first chapter rather confusing--and honestly there are still aspects that are unclear to me--I was fully invested in the fate of Haven Carmine Dr. Vincent DeMarco and Dominic. There are some twists that make the storyline wonderfully unpredictable and the plot is enhanced by a diverse cast of multi-faceted characters. Despite the length and pacing issues I liked this intriguing book. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel Sempre: Redemption.,3,1966-10-09 08:44:47
482,23626289,zakiabdelwahed,Ich habe auch beim dritten Teil das Horbuch gehort. Bereit die ersten beiden Teile konnten mich nicht wirklich packenaber Teil 3 habe ich personlich als noch etwas schwacher empfunden. Selbst das offene Ende konnte mich nicht dazu bringen wirkliche Spannung zu empfinden. Insofern werde ich diese Reihe erstmal pausierenwenn nicht sogar komplett abbrechen.,3,1976-10-27 21:36:23
483,18338465,thelorena,3.5 stars... I liked the idea of the story but everything seemed so tela-novella'd. It seemed very scripted like a bad play. Yes it had its moments but most of it was very predictable. In this novel The Mafia was depicted as such a nice and forgiving organization. I don't even know what to think of Carmine...he's just so off and on like a light switch. I also felt like the writing lacked a maturity that is needed when dealing with such strong topics. Overall cute read. Not sure about reading the second.,2,1950-05-29 20:20:56

485,22241198,metro83,So this was basically Wonder Woman in an erotic novel. Overall good but let's run through some things. First off through much of the book I just didn't find the main character likeable. She just seemed well too slutty to be a superhero and her overall morals could use a little work too. From a random encounter on a plane with a stranger to a sexual encounter with a married man (that was cleared up later but at the time it seemed a pretty low thing for her to do) to basically being gangbanged in public it just seemed that she was a little too horny to be super. At one point she even has sex and immediately rushes out to have sex again in public no less. I'd have thought since she just got off she could have at least waited a few minutes but I guess not. Maybe her sex drive is super powered as well? She was just constantly lying and keeping secrets regarding her sex life and she came across like sort of jerk in the middle of it all. Now in the author's defense the whole idea of "secrets" was partly what she based the novel on so perhaps there was a hidden meaning I missed. By the end of the book however I did have more compassion for the MC and her situation and while I thought the ending was a little too trite it was good ending overall and left me with a good feeling about the book in general. As far as the sex goes that part was good. The author left no stone uncovered as we had group scenes FF plenty of MF and even a little bit of MM but that was kept to a minimum. The author did a good job of keeping the scenes hot and dirty without going too vulgar nor keeping it "too clean." I think the author put a lot of herself into the sex scenes so to speak which adds a level of hotness to things. Overall if you're looking for a short hot read in the superhero genre this one is worth picking up. Id even like to see Liz Adams write from a villainess point of view and let her be as slutty as she wants to be without having to worry about morals at all!,4,1994-04-17 07:26:33
486,14289584,clifton233,The prolific Catholic apologist Dave Armstrong has a new book out 100 Biblical Arguments Against Sola Scriptura which was published by Catholic Answers. Now there is a certain irony in taking apart Sola Scriptura via the scriptures but you have to stay within a certain framework when dialoging with others. Jesus when talking to the Sadducees only quoted from the Pentateuch since this was all they accepted. So this apologetical pattern certainly applies here. Now first off when discussing Sola Scriptura it is best to define terms first. How Catholics might define Sola Scriptura can be quite simplistic compared to how many Protestants would understand it. So Dave Armstrong starts the book by quoting prominent Protestants as to exactly how Sola Scriptura is defined. Many of the arguments Dave Armstrong used are quite nuanced and interesting and go beyond some run-of-the-mill typical apologetics replies concerning the topic. In many ways Protestantism stands or falls on this since there must be some method of authority to answer questions. If you abandon the authority of a physical teaching Church than Sola Scriptura makes what appears as an acceptable fallback position. It is not enough to just refute Sola Scriptura though. Dave Armstrong as he methodically presents his arguments also sets the case for the understanding of authority presenting the three-legged stool of Scripture-Teaching Church-Sacred Tradition. He does this in a structured way discussing the authority of tradition authority of the Church and then answering common arguments used to defend Sola Scriptura. Apologetics books of this type can be for dry reading but I did not find that here as I was so interested by the arguments made and how they were presented. Certainly an excellent resource for the apologetic toolbox and one that goes in-depth on a fundamental topic.,1,1985-07-14 09:50:02
487,2093969,pallero,My brother suggested this book to me when he was flipping through my 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die. He said that the description vaguely reminded him of a certain game he used to play when he was younger. I usually associate video games with a certain addictive kind of fun some of them at least so I thought why don't I give this book a whirl? The short fantasy tale is about a mysterious prince who must undertake a seemingly impossible task to free the beautiful princess Saralinda from the clutches of the evil Duke. The book has everything from the typical evil villain to a woman who cries out jewelry--I thought the book was very amusing and I enjoyed reading the poetic writing style. Here are a couple of examples of what it sounds like: "From the sky came the crying of flies and the pilgrims leaped over a bleating sheep creeping knee-deep in a sleepy stream in which swift and slippery snakes slid and slithered silkily whispering sinful secrets" "'I have tales to make a hangman weep and tales to bring a tear of sorrow to a monster's eye. I have tales that would disturb a dragon's sleep and even make the Todal sigh'" And I found this to be particularly funny don't ask me why. "'What insolence is this?' the Duke demanded. 'What is that thing?' 'A ball' said Hark. 'I know that!' screamed the Duke. 'But why? What does its ghastly presence signify?'" LOL. The reason why it's only three stars and not higher has to do more with me than the book itself. I liked the characters but I thought they could have been fleshed out more although this book is short. All in all I would recommend it to people who enjoy fantasy and who feel like a light read.,1,2012-12-31 20:42:00
488,32606520,sergeuo,1st book I have read that is written by Jess. I will be reading more of her books. I was curious to see if the synopsis would say anything about the book having some racial tension? conflict? wanna be sure I say that right ... apparently Kanen is Indian and some of the other folks (characters in the book the not friendly kind people in this book.) don't approve or like his race or other races in general? Chastity is Canadian Texas is a ways away from Canada though? Wonder why Texas? I was curious about that? I know her back story but there are plenty of other states but I guess Texas is huge & cowboys are in other states too??! I will say that other people who have read & reviewed this book feel it was a rushed story? Not sure why? I feel you got to know the main characters Kanen & Chastity very well ... you understand they both have huge back stories & have been dealt some pretty trouble stuff in the past and have made it through those rough and tough times??! Not sure why they felt the way they did? I enjoyed the read. Chastity gets in trouble for working a waitress job 'cause she is just visiting. I could see more books maybe in a series from other characters in the book coming soon? a pretty lighthearted love story. Must read. Read it in a day quick read. ( ;,5,1994-08-09 20:17:40
489,23626289,robben96,Katy und Daemon kommen sich endlich naher. Alles scheint perfekt zu sein doch es ist nur die Ruhe vor dem Sturm. Plotzlich steht Blake wieder vor der Tur und bittet sie um Hilfe. Katy ist sich nicht sicher ob sie ihm trauen kann aber um ihre Freunde zu retten wurde sie alles tun - selbst ihr eigenes Leben aufs Spiel setzen. Was sie noch nicht weiss: Blakes Plan wird die Wahrheit uber die Lux endlich in greifbare Nahe rucken. Doch er wird Katy auch weiter von Daemon entfernen als sie es fur moglich halt. "Opal- Schattenglanz" ist der dritte Band der "Obsidian"-Reihe von Jennifer L. Armentrout. Wie bereits bei seinem Vorganger fallt der Einstieg in die Geschichte sehr leicht. Alles tritt wieder sofort lebendig vor Augen und fuhrt die Geschehnisse mit einer kleinen zeitlichen Unterbrechung fort. Auch hier gelingt der Mix aus Paranormal Romance und Science-Fiction wieder grossartig sodass man direkt ab der ersten Seite wieder in einem Abenteuer mit Katy gefangen ist. "Opal-Schattenglanz" beweist viel Spannung in seiner Handlung. Zwar ist nicht jede Seite mit uberbordenden spannenden Sequenzen versehen doch sturzt man recht oft in Szenen die das Mitfiebern moglich machen. Dabei finden sich etliche uberraschende Wendungen die diese Geschichte so gut wie nie vorhersehbar werden lassen. Auf keiner einzigen Seite fuhlt man sich in irgendeiner Form gelangweilt oder im Lesefluss ausgebremst. Jennifer L. Armentrout sorgt stets dafur dass sich die Handlung entwickelt und das Tempo flott bleibt. Seite um Seite vergehen wie im Flug sodass auch dieser dritte Band wieder ein echter Pageturner ist der vorallem zum Schluss mit einer gehorigen Portion Dramatik aufwartet die das Warten auf Band vier zur Qual werden lassen. Je weiter die Handlung voranschreitet umso dusterer wird die Atmosphare. Es wird gefahrlich bedrohlich und oftmals auch sehr nervenaufreibend. Doch immer wieder sorgen romantische und zwischenmenschliche Passagen fur die notige Abwechslung zwischen den packenden Sequenzen und lassen vorallem weibliche Leser gehorig schmachten. Immer wieder beweist die Autorin einen tollen Schreibstil welcher sich nicht nur dadurch auszeichnet dass er durchweg zu fesseln weiss sondern auch der Witz und die herrlich sarkastischen Dialoge und Monologe sorgen fur einen tollen Charakter der Geschichte. Wie bereits erwahnt zeichnet sich der Schluss durch ein hohes Mass an Dramatik aus. Auch der damit einhergehende Cliffhanger ist keineswegs zu verachten sondern lautet das Hibbeln auf Band vier ein der bereits im Dezember diesen Jahres erscheinen wird. Fazit: Jennifer L. Armentrout weiss auch in Band drei den Leser mit einer packenden Geschichte zu uberzeugen der man sich einfach nicht entziehen kann.,2,2017-10-06 22:09:50
490,10803536,martinuskowal,I received a copy of Dry Ice from the Amazon Vine Program and looked forward to reading it. It sounded like my kind of book - a scientific thriller. The story started out a bit slow with a lot of detail but stick with it and the thrills will come. The writing seemed a little disjointed at times probably because there are two authors. Overall I enjoyed it. The premise is intriguing with enough action to keep the pages turning.,1,1961-09-21 13:33:04

The pieces are almost in place for the final showdown.,5,1989-11-07 05:33:51
500,18777580,disinter,I am at a loss as to how to rate this book. No surprise the writing is quite lovely and it gets at the core of a lot of emotionally resonant issues. And the female friendship are wonderfully complex. But I felt like Sam was far more thoroughly developed than Nina and while there's resolution to her backstory especially as it relates to her parents I hope it would be more extensively explored. I also have issues with chickens due to our neighbors having a smelly gross noisy urban chicken shack abutting our property and chickens do play a role in this story. ;) If you liked the first book in this series you'll like this one and it shares a similar quiet tone.,1,1952-02-28 10:54:23

505,27212725,PAULBELL,What a lovely sweet sexy story from AM Kurylak. It was a really lovely story which had me turning the pages all the way through and by the end I was left wanting more! In this book we meet Jenna Harris. She is struggling through life at the moment and although gets on with things day to day her hopes and dreams of having a family have been dashed by a medical diagnosis which has the potential to affect her fertility. After her previous long-term boyfriend who she had hoped she had a future with left her she's holding out little hope for her dream. However she is trying to move on with life and at least have some fun. Her best friend is a brilliant character who really helps and supports her. We also meet Cole Jackson. He's a real life American Cowboy - just like Jenna has read about in her romantic books! And SWOON - Cole is lovely! He's such a gentleman handsome and loves what he see's in Jenna. But he is only here on holiday visiting family... Jenna has a serious lack of self esteem - she is not confident in her body at all yet Cole thinks she is beautiful. This story takes us on a ride with Jenna and Cole as they learn about each other. It's hot romantic and lovely. A few times Jenna irritated me and I wanted to give her a little shove in the right direction. But this book was very realistic and true to real life situations! Read this book and discover Jenna and Cole for yourself. Can their love survive the secrets the pasts and the walls which have been built around their hearts? And can it survive the distance? Overall I found this story a little predictable but lovely none the less. AM's writing style was good and I enjoyed the way the story flowed. Personally I would have liked a little more at the end maybe with an epilogue a few months or even years down the line but that doesn't take anything away from this sensitively written sexy and touching tale! A great debut novel from this author. **** 4 solid stars ****,4,1981-03-18 00:47:32

I think I'd mentioned at some point that this was one of my favorite stories I'd written in the past year or so. By now I've read it so many times that I have no idea about its quality.

507,18338465,awpebash,I never read this as a fic....I don't even know why I waited as long as I did to read it to begin with. I've read every other book J.M. Darhower has written this one I kept putting off....Now I could kick myself in the ass for waiting as long as I did. This book was brilliant it was amazing....at times I wanted to kick Carmine's ass for being suck a prick and others I wanted to take him into my arms and comfort him. Haven owned me from the word go my heart broke for her in so many ways I can even fathom what she went through. Vincent....I both loved and hated. How conflicted he must have been with raising his boys Maura and his lifestyle in general. I'm a huge fan of J.M. Darhower she's an amzing writer and I can honestly say I've never been disappointed by any of her words....they make me crave more.

I was expecting not to like this book but decided to slog through it anyway to fulfill my challenge category for the Booker award winner. I'm not exactly the high-brow reader - I read for escapism and enjoy vampire teen romance as much as the next old lady - so it came as a pleasant surprise when I found this book to be absolutely hilarious. Your mileage may vary.,4,2014-07-16 19:51:31
510,3312548,bakbaura,Cokie Roberts has been one of my favorite journalists for a long time now and her writings about the women of early America shows her at her best. She has clearly done extensive research to prepare this book and most of the sources are primary. She quotes letters and journals of the women commenting on a wide-ranging set of topics. One minute the women are discussing the politics of the day and the next disparaging the dress worn by a certain lady to a ball. It's all quite enjoyable. It has made me want to pursue other books about these women. And as Ms. Roberts narrates her own book it was a real treat.,1,1967-01-01 22:03:29

The dynamics of Freddie and Nas crackle along in this fast paced book and we slowly uncover why they are so awkward around each other and why they lost contact.

522,184859,snakanam,I wish there was a genre named "living life" or "relationships" rather than "romance" where Down by the River will be put. Ms. Carr puts so much grit so many hurdles of life in her books that I can proudly recommend her guys to gals and most happily to readers of "quality" literature. Just to whet your imagination a couple of the secondary protagonists cope with the situation of the woman / mother being the breadwinner. Down By The River has a couple nice plot twists but it isn't suspense or erotica nor are any bodices ripped. It is a good story about living real lives.,5,2019-02-02 12:30:42

524,2168737,242233,Once again Dan Slott proves that he is one of the few creators who really gets these characters and that he understands that above all else superheroes are supposed to be fun. He writes stories that are light and silly without ever letting them devolve into outright stupidity all while making it look completely effortless. Unfortunately he does go to great lengths to make sure everything maintains the status quo but that's a problem that is sort of endemic to the genre as a whole. For instance Slott jumps through a lot of hoops just to get Ben Grimm and Alicia Masters back together (a plot thread that is resolved far too easily) when it might have been much more interesting to just keep them as friends. Either way this is still a fun and exciting read and it features some gorgeous dynamic art.,1,1995-06-10 23:49:35

526,18338465,armanserow,Things I liked about the book: - Nicholas and his corny jokes. At one point I just started looking forward to a scene of whenever he'd pop up again. He brought much-needed humor to this book and it's a pity nearly all of them ended with Carmine punching his nose out. What happened to his character was a travesty. I uttered a small "No!" and was the closest to being emotionally moved. However closest doesn't mean I was actually moved. -Authentic use of Italian. Way to sch-mooze a girl! We even got an Italian lesson. Very small one about how words are altered to masculine and feminine depending who you're talking to. Nice detail! Most authors would plonk lines straight out of google translate and declare themselves done. - The first half to 3/4 of the book. Haven's trauma was beautifully handled. From going to a "slave" mindset to experiencing the world outside for the first time. The romance between Carmine and Haven was touching at parts if not generic. I'll talk more about that later. -The writing. Things I was't so crazy over: - List of memorable romances this ain't. If you were to ask me in a week's time to recall the main two characters in this book - I might struggle. Just a little. It won't even enter my top ten of romances I've read the past month. Purely because the romance is sub-standard (but still good) in a world so richly brought to life. The author did her research. She also knows her grammar. These two have served her well enormously. It's basically traumatized girl meets boy. Boy falls quick and deep. He changes his whole man-whore ethos. Has anger issues which are never dealt with and perhaps he's too possessive to his own good. Every-time he was laying into poor Nick I was firmly on Nick's side. - This book went on for 100 pages longer than I would've liked. It went from quite a dynamic world to suddenly being inserted into "The Godfather." All the posturing and staging a rescue for Haven after being kidnapped by the "Russians" by Nunzio - was that bit researched? Really? I felt like I was watching a B-movie (not that The Godfather was a B-movie.) Like all of it came straight out of watching films than any real experience. But then who has experience of being stuck between two rival mobs? Not the average person I'm sure. Overall I can understand why people are swooning over J.M. Darhower.,4,1966-05-24 20:50:55
527,18338465,altindish,My absolute very favorite mafia read!! This is just the beginning of the story but it will capture you and before you know it you are locked in the clutches of the emotional roller coaster that these characters experience! I'm an avid reader and have read thousands of books but this story captures me so completely that it is definitely one of my too ten favorite reads!! One I will read over and over!!,2,2004-08-19 08:46:06

529,18777580,cgrimes,What I liked most about Laugh was Sam. He's a guy that pulls you in while pushing you away. He was such an ass in the previous book in this series and Laugh made me see him in a completely different light. When Sam meets Nina all sorts of sparks fly between them. There is some serious heat between them from the start. Their connection is not just sexual and Nina understand the heart of Sam in a way no one else does--it's the sort of connection that soul-mades are made of. Although she resists him for a while it isn't long before these two are steaming up the sheets. Sam is still Sam though and before long he messes things up and not just with Nina. He's not on such good terms with his brother or sister either. I love the Burnside family dynamic in this series -- it's messy and real. Laugh is very much Sam's story about his journey of understanding himself with the help of a good woman. If you've read Mary Ann Rivers you know you get very close to the characters thoughts and feelings and I loved the way that Sam worked through what he wanted in life. I could relate to his tendency to beat himself up to be impulsive to love his family so much that it just comes out wrong. Where he ends up at that end of this book is pure joy. I like this series. I can't wait for Paul's book! ARC courtesy of publisher and Netgalley,1,1977-11-08 23:22:58
530,29237614,willardc1,I really love the supernatural suspense of this series. I didn't really notice it in #4 as much but with this one i did. We spend a lot of time building and building and then when we get to the end and I feel like there is a lot unresolved. I need more info on what happened. Like a balloon slowly filling then "pop" and we're done.,2,1993-09-28 09:44:44

I found the subject matter intriguing and significant. Although I was quite familiar with the famous imagery of Henri Rousseau there was so much about his life that I DIDN'T know before I read this wonderful book. I HIGHLY recommend it to parents teachers and art appreciators of all ages! -- H A L,4,2015-04-05 12:32:21

Now tasked with a new target CEO of a weapons company Oliver Kirkham but Oliver may just be the mission that she could possibly have second thoughts about. It was supposed to be one night it was never supposed to develop into something more. Can a woman who is used to walking away betray a man she is falling for? The first in the Seductor series by B.L.

533,25822224,THROTTLE,Reviewed by Kelley Austin for QUEERcentric Books 3.5 Stars 'Plaid Nights Anthology' edited by Andrea Dalling ReviewThe Plaid Nights Anthology edited by Andrea Dalling is a collection of stories that share the theme of the plaid kilt either in homage to Scottish heritage or just for the fun of it. They are all M/M romances and the men vary from brawny highlanders of long ago to creatures of the dark. The stories in Plaid Nights cover many genres from contemporary to paranormal. It doesn't matter if you like your stories sweet or you prefer something a little darker you will surely find something tasty in this anthology. Plaid Nights starts with "Tossing It" by Rob Rosen. College friends Greg and Tom find themselves at a highland festival together and then find themselves under the kilt of the winner of the caber toss. If you're interested in the paranormal "Sir WW" by Angelique Voisen introduces a time-travelling vampire who has a taste for ropes. "Feumaidh Mi Ruith (I Have to Run)" by Missouri Dalton gives us a thief named Cary who steals from the wrong guy--but maybe this doesn't turn out to be such a bad thing. Also in this genre is "Kilt in the Closet" by Logan Zachary where Jeff asks a real estate agent for his help to solve the mystery of the kilt-wearing ghost in his closet.

I am not sure why expect with this book and the fact is when I started to read I haven't clue of nothing because I forgot read the plot. This book is a bit dark or some dark because has dark feelings and pretty bad situations. I don't want spoil nothing but gor me Andra is a fighter and well Julian he is complicated for me and the things close to the end of this book were a shock for me I wasn't expecting something like this. Great book. This author is great and more people should be reading her books. 5 STARS!,1,1967-05-29 16:16:21

542,32606520,ilyinston4ik,I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. This was a really good book. I liked the setting in Texas and the southern feel. The bull riding was fun and new for me as a reader. The one thing I absolutely loved more than anything was that the main character Kanen is Native American. It was so great and refreshing to have a book with dynamic characters and to talk about the heritage and racism of Native Americans. I felt an instant connection to Chastity. Her story was so sad and I wanted her to get everything she wanted and deserved. The instant connection between Chastity and Kanen was so sweet and heartwarming. The sexual tension the tender touches and the confusion of the feelings brewing in their hearts. It had the sweetest ending ever. Really enjoyed this book as I am surprised to find that I enjoyed a sweet western romance.,4,1955-03-23 01:50:02

545,18777580,elenkamadlenka,Sam Burnside is a doctor who works too much and worries about his siblings too much. He's driving his partner in a new health clinic crazy so she sends him off on errand to volunteer with a local farmer and build some goodwill in their community. Nina Paz is that farmer and the chemistry between the two of them is immediate and electric. The thing is they both have some pretty serious issues they're dealing with. Sam's got some crazy ADHD and a way of pushing away the brother and sisters he loves so much. Nina is ten years out from the death of her husband. She's distanced herself from her family and built a new one made of a tight knit group of friends but she's still dealing with her losses. This was a hard read for me. Not hard emotionally but I had a hard time connecting to the characters. Honestly it seemed to require a lot of reading between the lines to understand what was going on and how the characters were feeling. That's something I've really enjoyed in the previous books I've read by Mary Ann Rivers but I struggled with it in this book. Additionally both Sam and Nina have lives filled with really tough and sad situations. I know they took hope from their relationship and each other but it was pretty depressing to read. On the other hand it's full of one liners that made me laugh - the dialog is hilarious! The characters are believable. Sam's ADHD was very interesting to read about. It wasn't a mild childhood thing that passed with age but something he continued to struggle with and cope with. That read very real to me. He's impulsive and blurts things out and this causes him problems in his relationships. Watching Nina come to understand this was very sweet. I'll definitely read more Mary Ann Rivers and I'm thinking the dark tone of the things Sam and Nina were dealing with was just too much for me in this story.,1,1970-10-18 09:01:45

549,1133518,dammpill,I'd like to hug Herr and Anderson for writing this book. I have been plagued by all kinds of doubts and insecurities running around calling myself a "poor-excuse for a grad student" because of my commitment to prioritizing my work on-the-ground. I've read plenty on the various strands of Participatory Action Research (PAR) and done some reflection but I still felt muddled. The book speaks directly to doctoral students who embrace an action research paradigm. For me every page was like a sigh of relief: the clear framework to understand different approaches to PAR concrete examples from other students who have "done it" and practical advice -- everything from dealing with dissertation committees to approaching IRB. I had gotten pretty far in thinking about my dissertation approach based purely on intuition and cobbling together my own reading but this book gave me tools to organize my scattered thoughts. It's going to be a lot of work but now at least I know better where I'm going.,5,1961-10-20 15:21:50

554,23442272,sileas,Sono stata tentata piu di una volta di mollare la lettura e solo alla fine ho trovato qualche spunto pur trovando il libro faticosissimo e frammentario. Katja Petrowskaja ci porta con se nella sua ricerca delle radici nella ricostruzione della vita e delle disavventure dei sui antenati attraverso l'europa tormentata del XX secolo attraversando eventi storici quali la rivoluzione Russa i pogrom due guerre mondiali e la disgregazione della Unione Sovietica. La storia della famiglia intreccia la storia di Polonia Ucraina e Russia e tocca da vicino l'intero centro Europa sulle tracce di radici distanti. Non un diario non una narrazione "storica" ma un ripercorrere storie e fatti in un continuo avanti e indietro seguendo non una narrazione organica ma il percorso di ricostruzione e scoperta dell'autrice. Nel suo continuo mescolare luoghi persone epoche ed emozioni io mi sono persa e non ho apprezzato nulla del libro. Non la storia non la ricostruzione non lo stile narrativo. Troppo frammentario e faticoso per me e non e bastato riannodare quelche lieve filo verso la fine del libro quando la narrazione sembra stabilizzarsi per togliere la sensazione di un viaggio su un mare uin burrasca che lascia lo stomaco in subbuglio ed impedisce di focalizzare l'attenzione su qualunque evento o dettagli.,5,1978-08-27 08:36:17
555,6531819,lordlion20,Agatha Christie is awesome. This book was written 45 years before I was born and it felt fresh and real. It was one of those page-turners where you neglect your friends and relatives in order to stay in the imaginary world conjured up by the magician with the pen and paper. And so it was on the August long weekend that I found myself neglecting my poor husband in order to find out who the killer was. And it was so satisfying. I don't regret it. He's a grown up. He can feed himself and usually manages to dress himself. Though I did take a three hour air conditioning and darkness break (where they were showing Cowboys & Aliens) I wasn't thinking about the entertainment the air conditioning company was providing. I was trying to figure out who the hell was responsible. I thought it was the religious zealot and I was so wrong. So very wrong. Oh the dialog! So good. The foreshadowy poem! Lovely and creepy! I kept flipping back to it to try and figure out how the next person was going to be offed! It was wonderful! And it was so satisfying that these people who didn't technically kill anyone were getting what they really deserved! There's a reason this is the best selling mystery book ever. I'm so glad I read it and I'm also very glad I didn't get a copy of this book with the original title. This one is better. I'm going to go watch that episode of Doctor Who with Agatha Christie and the killer space bee (seriously folks... Killer. Space. Bee).,2,2020-07-22 18:16:00

557,18488643,kinski85,Original review here: http://offbeatvagabond.blogspot.com/2013/12/release-day-review-giveaway-desire.html There are not enough cold showers in the world to brace you for this one. I love the concept of this book. It is very sexy and exhilarating. Wilde really knows how to drive you crazy. I loved this book a lot and I am really anticipating book 2 especially with that ending. I really liked Jade. Her personality was very strong and aggressive. Not to mention she is quite cocky at times but she has a right to be. She is so good at her job of being a Seductor. As a Seductor she seduces or has sex with men to gain secrets for clients. It could be diamonds incriminating photos or top secret files that could have very sensitive information. She doesn't care about the who or the why she just gets the job done and she is the best at it. Then she is given the biggest mission her company has come across. She has to get close enough to a man named Oliver to steal information from his hard drive that contain the blueprints to nuclear weapons. I loved Oliver. That man can easily turn me to jelly. When I heard the mission I was expecting someone crazy or evil but he was nothing like that. He was uber sexy and fun. I love the chemistry he builds with Jade. He slowly starts breaking down Jade tough exterior even though she was very reluctant. He is an assignment he shouldn't be anything more. But he is very careful about who he shares his work with. He knows the risk and it is a family business. Jade sees this but she knows she must get the job done even if she is falling for him. I really loved the concept. Seductors are on board for ten years they are not allowed out of their contracts any earlier than that or it can lead to terrible consequences. But Jade loves her job enough she knows the ten years will be easy If you don't complete a mission someone will take care of it and then kill the target. Jade never thought she would fall for a target but Oliver is nothing like the men she has been assigned to. She knows that falling for him will be an awful mistake for them both. She never thought it would be a problem but now she isn't so sure. This book is very full of sex scenes and I loved them all. Do not read this while at work you will regret it. But it is definitely worth reading. The characters are strong and memorable. I also love the amount of emotion in this book as well. You really feel a connection to Jade and her situation. It is truly terrible and you will feel for her. I enjoyed this book so much. The second book can't get here fast enough. I need more. Again that ending. Oh my goodness. You got to check this out you will definitely fall in love.,4,2006-06-16 09:09:25

561,33667101,ltdtg,*I received a free copy of the eBook in exchange for an -honest- review* 1920s Italy and supernatural creatures. What more could a girl want? ...Apparently a lot. I don't know what it was about this book but I just did not get into it at all. I had no connection to any of the characters and absolutely zero emotion towards any of the events happening in the plot. If I'm being totally honest I probably half-assed skimming through 75% of this book kinda like if I had to read a chapter in a textbook for school. There are a few reasons why I didn't really get into this book. I might be forgetting a few things but these were the biggest things that jumped out at me: --The beginning I felt was pretty confusing which made the rest of the story pretty hard to get into --The alternating chapters really did not help my confusion at all --There are SO MANY characters. Like maybe I'm crazy but I feel like there were literally a hundred. That coupled with the alternating chapters really did not help the impression I got from this book. Overall this book was just really disappointing. I feel bad because I received a free copy from the author but I always try to be as honest in possible in my reviews and it'd be really hard to write a gushing 5-stars review even if I wanted to. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because it really is a neat plot idea and maybe others will like the orchestration better than I did but that's about as much as I can offer.,1,1985-05-07 10:19:06
562,18338465,Ro!,Many thanks to my book girlfriend Camille for recommending this book to me. <3 This book has been on my TBR for ages and I finally get to pick this book up. Just the perfect timing I'm still on the mood for Mafia/Assassin themed books (currently obsessing with it). Haven Antonelli grew up as a slave with her mother and they're both abused for years. She lived her whole life being afraid because of it and never lose hope that one day she'll be free. When Dr. Vincent DeMarco-- a Mafia member-- took her she's adjusting to a new rich life that she never had. She still works hard for doing household chores and has yet to earn Dr. DeMarco's trust. Also she met his sons Dominic DeMarco and Carmine DeMarco. Carmine somewhat made her curious. He has this bad boy image and he has a strained relationship with his father because of what happened in the past. They're both longing for someone and understand each other's feelings despite of being flawed. So many things happened and everything has put them into a test. Sempre is simply a gem and it gave me a bad case of book hangover. It took me a while to write something and organize my thoughts. Oh my god. What a beautiful story between a slave and a mafia prince (a hot-damn-colpo di fulmine-worthy- mafia - prince) . I think this is a perfect book to start when you're going to dive in to Mafia themed books for the following reasons: - It's somewhat in between YA and NA. - Trigger warning: there is an abuse but it's less graphic/violent. Not to the point you will cringe. I find it mild unlike the other ones I've read. - It focuses more on the character / family drama. The plot is well written and each scenes are very detailed. J.M Darhower's writing style is hands down beautiful and I'm fully engrossed with the story. The romance between the characters is absolutely slow burn and the other thing that I love about this entire novel all the characters aren't left out. Everyone has their role in the story and they played it so good and they're all complex. Dr. DeMarco is probably the most complex character. He's a broken and stern man with a huge heart. Carmine may not understand his good intentions but I love how he's protective of him and doesn't want his son to expose into a dangerous life. He wants Carmine to live free and not follow his footsteps. Whatever happens he's there for his son for good and bad times. Haven is indeed a strong heroine. She's selfless loving and caring. Her character development is such a wonderful thing to see.Grab me some cherry coke and let me fangirl on Carmine DeMarco. My Mafia Prince. Goodness lord I'm a sucker for bad boys. He's a sweet bad boy and his love for Haven... "Haven I could never love someone like you because there isn't anyone else like you. You're one of a kind." eeeeeee!!! *squeals more like a banshee*I swear there are more swoon worthy quotes especially what Colpo di fulmine means (not going to mention it here because you need to find out) and Overall I love this book..per sempre,2,1953-05-17 08:33:59

564,16130164,avrtrans,Blood Warrior starts not long after the end of the first book in the Dragon Kings series Caged Warrior. Tallis Pendray having fled the scene of the rescue of his niece Nan in book 1 has found the one woman he has been searching decades for. The goddess known as 'The Sun' has been visiting him for twenty years through his dreams influencing him to kill several of his own kind. He was in fact involved in the murder of Nan's human husband in Caged Warrior. Tallis decides to take matter into his own hands by seeking retribution on the one person who has controlled his life. No one is more surprised than Tallis when he finds himself on the run the run with the lovely goddess Kavya protecting her from the brother who wants to her dead. More is revealed about the history of Tallis his family and the dragon king race. Through Kavya we come to learn about the powers of the Indranan race and of the Pendray through Tallis. It reminded me a tiny bit of gaming characters where you pick a race and have a main power or skill - the Pendrays are berserkers Indranans are telepaths Maleforneys channel lighting and added into this mix are the half breeds like Nan who have multiple powers from both parents. A theme throughout both books is that the dragon kings as a species are dying out. I couldn't really understand was why this was happening as there was really no explanation as to why the dragon kings had become infertile. Nan from Caged Warrior had obviously had a child with a human so I wasn't entirely sure why more weren't doing the same. The plot is fairly fast paced with a journey starting in India and ending in Scotland. The environment seems to be cast as an alternative character moving quickly from a tempestuous snow storm to bleak barren wilderness. Piper uses the weather and landscape to mirror the mood between the two lead characters to good effect. Missing from the story however is any further development of the Aster plot which I think is a bit disappointing. Aster is a strong antagonist but the plot of this story seems to side track him in favour of Kavya's equally evil brother. Overall Blood Warrior is more your traditional PNR with the virginal misunderstood Kavya and the handsome rebel in the form of Tallis. While I thought there wasn't enough history in Caged Warrior but liked the fact there was a strong female lead in Blood Warrior it was the exact opposite. There is much more detail about the the different races but Kavya is much more the 'femme fatale'. Although saying that I have to appreciate any woman who can traipse through a snow storm in India in no more than a sari and slippers and still look gorgeous! There is a lot more happening in this instalment but it seems to end rather abruptly. I am fairly conflicted about this series. On one hand I like Piper's world building and the history/folklore surrounding the dragon kings but I just don't like the characters that much themselves. I want something compelling that makes me want to cheer them on even though I may not agree with what they are doing. Apart from Tallis the other characters are a bit bland. Even the lovely Kavya is a tad one one dimensional. I am looking forward to book three which will feature 'The Pet' from book 1 and the Giva who is the leader of the dragon kings. From reading the introductory chapters of this third book I get the feeling that Piper has been slowly building the plot and the character development for future books in the series...or at least I hope that is the case. The Dragon Kings series has a little of something for everyone but not consistently over the first two books. While they are definitely PNR Caged Warrior focuses more on the plot especially of the Asters while Blood Warrior reverts more back into traditional PNR. If like me you were looking forward to this plot developing then tread carefully as Blood Warrior doesn't develop the overarching plot. Blood Warrior is solid PNR and sometimes everyone needs a little happily ever after!,5,1958-07-20 01:45:48
565,30741810,derbendli,"Everyone matters" I knew after reading Blonde Ice that I had to go back and read the other two books in the Gil Malloy series. I loved Blonde Ice and I was excited to begin reading The Kennedy Connection. It took no time for me to become immersed in poor Gil's drama. Gil's is down on his luck. There is only one word that could describe his downfall: Houston. Houston is the prostitute Gil based a whole series of newspapers articles on. There was just one tiny problem no one could confirm Houston existed. Gil never really met her but he knew of her through all the people he interviewed. Although morally wrong he made the decision to print the articles despite not been able to prove she was real and when he was discovered his credibility as a newspaper reporter plummets by the time the book starts. Due to recent panic attacks Gil is forced to see a therapist and when a cop friend asks him to investigate a shooting that happened over a decade ago Gil feels this is a way towards recuperating some on his own dignity. However Gil is asked to interview a man who claims to be the son of Lee Harvey Oswald and he alleges he has proof his father didn't kill JFK. Gil can't turn down this opportunity without realizing this will take his life on a collision course one he might not be able to drag himself out of. Whoa... what a great way to spin of the murder of JFK! What if Lee Harvey Oswald is not the killer or sole killer of JFK? A lot of conspiracy theories say he wasn't and R. G. Belsky takes you on a formidable ride towards a different scenario. It was a pleasure reading this thriller. There are so many things I liked about it. I loved Gil's relationship with his ex-wife. He was to blame for the distance he created in their relationship and later on their divorce but he's willing to recognize his faults and remain friends with her. He told her how important she was to him. She's also the only person he truly trusts and cares for. What I love the most about this book is how good Gil is as an investigative reporter. Once he has a lead he doesn't quit until he knows there is anywhere else to go with the information. I like that Gil had to understand that he needed help and by the end he was willing to do whatever it took to make himself better as a friend reporter and altogether better human being. I do have to say that I missed how brilliantly sarcastic Gil can be. In The Kennedy Connection his sarcastic personality is there but not as predominantly as in the last book.

566,184859,pyhome,The characters were as engaging as usual and the subplot involving aunt Myrna was amusing as all get out. Most of the book held up very well but the ending struck me as a bit weak and not up to Carr's usual level.,2,1967-04-27 10:02:07

570,16130164,sept77,Tallis a fierce Pendray warrior from a clan made up of warlike berserkers has become a pariah even among his family. Haunted in dreams by a beautiful goddess she has instructed him to commit vile acts to unite the five clans of the Dragon Kings. Disgusted with himself he has developed an overwhelming hatred for the female known only as the Sun. Determined to end his suffering he has traveled the world to find and destroy her. Kavya longs to end the civil war raging amongst her clan the Indranan. A telepathic people they are cursed to kill their siblings to absorb their powers. Pursued by her brother Pashka she is disgraced when he commits mass murder at a gathering to promote peace. To top it off she is kidnapped by a mad man who claims she has taken over his dreams. Fleeing for her life she learns a strength and depth of love that she never thought to possess. I will admit that I started this series in the middle so I had a lot of catching up to do. Boy did it pay off. This book had every element I look for in a great book. Tallis was the epitome of an alpha male. Strong loyal and intelligent he also had depth and personal insight. He was so damaged and longing for solace and peace he just wanted to go home. I wanted to bundle him up and give him cookies. (Then jump his bones.) Kavya started out a little too hippieish for my taste. She made tremendous strides during her journey and really turned into quite the laudable heroine. The story in and of itself was full of action and the world was a wonderful mix of modern and old world elements. The Dragon Kings were a captivating blend of clans full of magic startling differences and a burgeoning commonality. While in Blood Warrior the story is the star it had enough sexual tension and actual hotness to keep even a perv like myself more than happy. Being a self confessed series slut I deeply regret having just discovered Ms. Piper's Dragon King series. Don't repeat my mistake read it now.,2,1969-11-01 04:23:12
571,18338465,katenamuse,A copy of this title was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This review can also be found at The Starry-Eyed Revue. Wow. If Sara's love for this novel hadn't come through loud and clear in her review I might not have ever given this book a chance and that's a shame. But I did read it and I kinda sorta loved it. And I trust Sara's judgment but that still comes as a surprise to me because this book is really out of my comfort zone. Sure I like books featuring crime and the mob in one fashion or another like the Curse Workers series by Holly Black but with the human-trafficking aspect and all the violence this book seemed too real and not at all like something I'd typically enjoy. Boy was I wrong. Because one of the things I like to read about best is a morally ambiguous character and Sempre is chock-full of them. The characters in this book are malicious vindictive and all around horrible human beings. Most of them anyway. And yet...and yet I couldn't make myself hate them. Not all of them anyway. The point I'm trying to make is that no matter how much I wanted to be disgusted with their actions with their behavior wanted to judge them as reprehensible and be done with them I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Because deep down I wanted to believe that they had it in their hearts to do the right thing when it all came down to it. Most especially Dr. DeMarco. The writing in this story was realistic. It felt legitimate not that I'd really know what legitimate was when it came to a mafia family but it read as genuine. Less like the BS you'd find in a crime drama on TV and more like the dialogue you'd see between family members who care about each other but never really quite understand one another and their position. Without all the gun-toting and violence this could be a typical family still grieving over the loss of their matriarch years after her death. I read this book several weeks ago but it has really stuck with me. Aside from the issue of human slavery I think the romance was the focal point but it was handled in a way that didn't overshadow the other issues at large. When you meet Carmine he's a bit of a prick. But love can change people and that's just what happens when he allows himself to know Haven. Haven due in part to the life she's lived up to this point is unbelievably naive but Carmine sort of takes her under his wing as does his older brother Dom. They can't save her from her past but the DeMarcos just might ensure she has a future. I wouldn't exactly call this novel a foray into new adult because the main characters are still high school age but there are definitely situations that are not suitable for a younger audience. There is a lot of language that some might find offensive (I'm not one of them) there are sexual encounters there is an unbelievable amount of violence (some that leads to death) but worst of all is the human trafficking. I think that subject was explored at length and in-depth and though it's not something that anyone will ever be comfortable with I applaud the author for being so open and honest about it and the repercussions the fact that slavery is still a very real issue today decades and decades after it was officially abolished. This novel started out as a self-published piece which was later picked up by Gallery Books for distribution but you'd never know it. It doesn't suffer from a lack of editing. It doesn't suffer from over-used tropes or poor characterization. Sempre is just a beautifully sad story of expectations longing and loss infused with gorgeous Italian phrases and heartbreakingly told through the eyes of several of the characters. If you enjoy stories that open your eyes to the horrors of the world or if you're willing to step out of your comfort zone in order to experience one that will I highly recommend this novel.

573,13331150,jelannayatebe,This novel is a story of old friends married couples in southwestern Wales and how their lives change when Alun and Rhiannon Weaver return to the country after Alun's long career in London. Alun has for some time been an ambitious media personality whose career resulted in the "popularization" of Wales. He is vaguely blamed for the onslaught of developers and bad architecture in the country though this seems to me baseless. He's also known for championing the Welsh poet Brydan whom I suspect is loosely based on Dylan Thomas. Alun's as pure a "shit" Amis's word as you're likely to come across in English letters. A vile bastard masquerading as a chum. At once upon his return he commences to systematically cuckold most of his friends whom he then routinely meets the next day at the Bible and Crown for round after round of powerful cirrhotic drinks. Everyone or almost everyone in The Old Devils drinks themselves into near insensibility on a daily basis. For what else is there to do in culturally bereft Wales? Peter Thomas was a local college professor in the old days. Back then he seduced and knocked up his student Rhiannon still something of a beauty today whom he promptly left for one Angharad under the delusion of greener pastures. He's an old fool but at least unlike Alun he knows he's an old fool. Peter is now married to the imperious Muriel. He's fat pushing 70 with a failing heart and he regrets his hasty youthful choices. In other words he's still in love with Rhiannon. Then there's Charlie the book's purest alcoholic who's been suffering lately from panic attacks and his wife Sophie the first old flame to succumb to slick Alun's inexplicable charms. There's also Malcolm Cellan-Davies more of a Welsh scholar than Alun will ever be and his wife Gwen who also falls under Alun's spell. Structurally The Old Devils is a traditional novel; there is nothing new or even innovative about it. There are no sophomoric metafictional tricks for which I was grateful. The novel beguiles us chiefly through its mastery of technique. It is so sure footed. It makes a virtue of the run on sentence. It was surprising to find amid the rich comedic scenes these stretches of striking descriptive beauty. Amis got the Booker Prize for this novel and one can see why. Here is everything he knows from the writing of what twenty novels? Here it is all in one book. The last third I found moving; a surprise since emotion was never something Kingsley Amis's work was known for. He was essentially a comic novelist like his son. That was another striking thing the similarity of phrasing between father and son. One can almost imagine them arguing about the merits of a proper sentence during their famous weekly meetings (see Experience: A Memoir). Highly amusing often LOL funny. Exuberantly recommended.,2,2019-10-07 15:46:41

575,16130164,holita,While the relationship in this book was better developed than the last in the series there were a few background plot points that could have used some fleshing out.

576,27384500,skipar,If you're a social media user then this book is going to interest you because you're aware of the online community the worlds that thrive in it how we all interact and how when circumstances are right things can go horribly horribly wrong. The online world is a melting pot of personalities and yet for the most part we thrive side by side. It's when there is something to see like car crash TV that social media gets a life all of its own and this is explored here. Clarke turns social media into a terrifyingly dark place. You won't look at your accounts the same way again. Or you will at least wonder who is on the other side of that screen you are talking to. I was hooked and couldn't stop turning the pages. It was compulsive. With a memorable and unique protagonist Follow Me comes at the crime novel from a slightly different angle with down on her luck living on a sofa in London journalist Freddie. She's brilliant to read. She's real. You know she's out there. Mouldy plates and a pillow on a sofa trying to make her way trying to make it big. Well not much comes bigger than this. Clarke explores the phenomenon of social media celebrity while tapped into your fears of the unknown. There's a murderer out there and he's hiding in plain sight. He's telling the world all about it. You can follow him and watch. But you really don't want him to follow you back... Brilliant! With thanks to the author and publisher for my copy.,4,2018-09-30 13:18:40
577,32606520,ogdenp,Sometimes riches lie in the most nondescript places. Bucked is the first book I've read by Jess Bentley. I'll be honest and say I saw the cowboy on the cover and I wanted it asap. This story is short but full of charm although it did lack that emotional punch I look for. Kanen is a big name in the bull riding circuit and he's got his eye on Chastity who's new to town. He lays on the charm and the good ole boy manners and it's super sexy! The Southern drawl is just on point and I could hear it while reading. He's not looking for a commitment but then neither is the shy awkward Chastity. Chastity moved from Canada to Texas after losing her husband and unborn child in a car wreck. She doesn't need a man let alone one who looks like bad boy Kanen. But maybe this could be her second chance. She has to come to terms with a lot and decide if she's capable of love or if it's worth it. There are some heavy topics in this book--immigration racism love lost. I liked how the story tackled these issues. It's interwoven well into the story. While this is a good little read the story needed something more for me. Significant parts of the plot felt too abrupt or were glossed over. I like the nitty-gritty details and as a reader I just look for stories that wring my emotions out piece by piece. By the end of this one I felt removed from the characters. I definitely recommend Bucked for those who love cowboy romances. It mixes a little sweet with a bundle of steam and is all about second chances. 3 stars. Reviewed by Michaelene from Alpha Book Club,2,1952-09-22 09:09:04

582,16130164,johnfischer2,We first met Tallis in Caged Warrior and I loved him. He's a berserker and definitely one of the fiercest. Kavya (our heroine) also is so charismatic so powerful that she's the center of a cult. The two have an attraction yet powerful emotion leads to not just lust but annoyance. : ) I also love the idea of triplets and cult leaders and all the craziness that ensues. Lindsey definitely knows how to stuff her books full of interesting characters and situations. While I absolutely loved Lindsey's writing (she's got talent!) and have adored her Dragon Kings books this one has some plot holes that bothered me. They were small enough not to detract from the overall story line though. To see what Lindsey has to say check out the HEA Blog! http://www.usatoday.com/story/happyev...,5,1980-01-31 07:51:29

592,16130164,balajee,It was a mistake to begin this when I did; I had just finished two great books one fantasy one supernatural romance. Going on to another of similar genera was almost bound to disappoint but it was a library loan there was a due date so I began. Even had the timing been perfect I doubt this book would have ever worked for me. I was skim reading before I had hit page 10. As I skim read I was analysing my feelings about the story (and it is a bad sign that you are so uninvolved that you can do this) and I came to a couple of conclusions: 1)	 I am likely to find any story that goes straight to the gyrating sex boring and uninvolving. If I don't first get a hint of the person with the hard on (or the person he has it for) a smidgeon of plot or at least a lick of worldview first. I'll be a bit bored. 2)	I do NOT like revenge sex and I emphatically do NOT find it hot I find it icky. Apparently I strongly prefer things consensual even in pure fantasy novels. I do like the dynamic tension of a love story where the two desperately want each other but cant have each other but I don't even get a tingle from a person using sex as a weapon. So given that the gyrating started on page 2 of the prologue and that revenge kissing was the main order of the day for the first twenty or so not for me. I persevered for a while though as initially I thought that the plot elements had potential. At around page 80 male lead discovers female lead is not the woman in his dreams (duh). By page 130 I was skimming much more than reading plot emerges at an agonisingly slow rate; about one event per ten pages the rest is made up of banal 'romantic tension style' dialogue or male and female leads being chastely attracted to each other. Even more frustrating an event will start to happen and then drift off for a page or two of introspection. An example being at one point: Male Lead; Does that sky say anything to you? (yes they are talking about the weather and as it is the first time in pages that they have talked about anything but themselves you know it has to be a major plot builder). For the next half a page we hear what she thinks about his thigh pressing against hers. By the time we get back to the weather we have lost any sense of the weather as a plot element. And also most of our care factor about the plot in general. Incidentally these guys are meant to be dragons with a host of interesting powers but it reads like a seventies Mills and Boon. Yes that interesting. Will he leave or won't he? The initial sex has vanished to be replaced by nothing at all. Life's too short to read bad books. And Lindsey - for goodness sake if at all possible SACK whoever chose that idiotic cover of two American co-eds!,5,2014-02-12 09:47:50
593,22998742,golantarm,Jaime has a wonderfully compelling story with the later half of this epic-like journey culminating in the 1984-like future world. With perfection on the surface covering and hiding the rotten underworld it's definitely a futuristic dystopian and I love those types of stories. The idea of a world so steeped in 'saving face' and covering up the institutionalised racism is definitely something I LOVE to read. A unique and wonderful representation of what we could and probably shouldn't be. This is a heavy book full of racial and social prejudice clearly intended as a comment on current racial tension and and international incidents such as those that have occurred in Britain the USA and Australia to name a few. However from the ditching of the black MC at the airport to his beating by Muslim youth to the indifference posed by white highway patrol this book feels like nothing more than "white shaming" for the sake of it. Pamela ditches because he's not the tall white guy she presumed he was. The Muslims blame his white president for the situation he's in. The highway patrol takes one look at him and the rain and drive on. That said I have only marked it down one star. It's not as bad as it seems. In fact it's more enjoyable the further in you get with excellent pacing wonderful characters and compelling plots until you can't really remember reading your way through the last 4 hours. 4/5,3,1956-02-19 20:58:03
594,23626289,sergkhudyak,It was better than Onyx but still not the best. I liked the story really I do enjoy this series but something's missing. Everything is repeating the same thoughts the same descriptions... it's annoying. Really - I understand that Daemon is an awesome kisser. Some things feel so inappropriate - someone dies Katy is crying - but hey they have sex. I don't like how this "love" is portayed. People disappear people and friends die but this is not important when you have a Daemon. I know love is good and fine but it is unrealistic! (SPOILER!!!) Carissa dies - making out with Daemon helps. Will is killed - Katy and Daemon almost die: let's have sex. This can't be true. I liked Katy a little bit more in this book but I didn't really like Daemon. He wants to control everything and says the same things over and over again. Though I stopped hating Katys mother! Is that a good sign? I think so. Lets hope she will not die because every character I like dies sooner or later. That would probably explain why Blake isn't dead yet... There was more action and more romance - which I didn't really appreciate the romance was a little bit too much -and overall the characters saved this book. Especially Luc. I don't know how but I loved him from the first second and I hope we'll see more of him. I can't give this book a 5/5 rating. I really wanted to but Daemon and this whole making-out/sex-thing was to inappropriate when it comes to timing so it will just be a 4/5 rating.,2,1958-07-07 18:50:39

596,18488643,kitovika,Small disclaimer - Since this reviewthe cover has changed and I have to say the new one is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! 4.5 out of 5 for this reader folks! WOW .. well that was a totally different (in a great way) and SUPER HOT read. Desire by B.L. Wilde is most definitely classified as an erotic novel. While the smut was yummy and plentiful I have to say the actual storyline was quite unique and not something I have come across before (not that I can think of right now anyway ...lol). Meet sexy strong minded nothing gets in her way Jade. Jade is an employee to a company called "The Seductors". These are men and woman who are trained in the art of seduction in order to manipulate a "target". Clients hire a seductor for many reasons. A seductor is trained to be the best and not just the best at seduction. A seductor is held to a high standard of fitness personal image special ops and yes .. SEX! Jade is considered to be a top seductor within the company. She can manipulate and distance herself from any target she has been given and ALWAYS gets the job done! Jade's latest target is Oliver the CEO of a company that specializes on nuclear weapons. Jade's mission is simple ... seduce Oliver and get close enough to extract essential files on his computer. Easy enough for the top seductor right??? Ya ... not so much! ;) What Jade doesn't expect is to have her mind blown by this wicked and wonderful man. For the first time Jade is somewhat feeling a little trumped and is experiencing feelings that have no business in surfacing. Oliver rocks her world in ways that make him the hardest target she has ever had. So much more to this story .. I am not giving you any more goodies. LOL I will say I was captivated by the story and the smut made my toes curl in the best way ever. These two lit my e-reader on fire! ;) It was intense at times especially reading how Jade lowers her walls and let's Oliver see her vulnerable side. Lines get blurred as the relationship progresses leaving Jade to question if a mission is in fact worth it. The writing was excellent. I was completely drawn in. My only negative remarks will be about the cover and the ending. The cover needs to match this amazing book and right now it looks a little on the cheap side. The ending .. hard to comment on this without giving much away so all I'll say is that I was a little confused if I was left with a cliffhanger or a true ending. I guess I'll find out when her next book in this series is released! ;) HAPPY READING!,5,1960-04-01 02:05:43

598,18777580,romanorlov795,Sam. Sam is perfect. And yes I know I claimed otherwise when I read Live. A girl reserves the right to change her mind okay? Oh yes Sam is my new favorite MAR (That's Mary Ann Rivers' for you) leading man. And trust me when you read this you'll know he's all man. Laugh is Sam Burnside's story. In Live Destiny Burnside Sam's little sister who shouldered her sibling's burdens emotionally and physically all out of love for them - fell in love herself. Sam the eldest sibling didn't do much to help her in return. And he came across as a major a$$hole. But in Laugh we get Sam's other sides. The other facets to his personality his behavior and his gorgeousness. Sam has ADHD and while we know how this disorder affects children and adolescents we don't always think how it affects those children when they grow up to be adults. It doesn't just go away with age. That's what's so special about MAR's writing. She knows how to take these everyday "ailments" we never think about and make a story of them. Call it what you will I call it brilliance! Back to Sam. We know from book one that together with Lacey Des's best friend and nurse extraordinaire he's opening a neighborhood clinic. The clinic enters some sort of community collaboration with the local farm owned and run by Nina Paz a gorgeous Latina widow. And now Sam's object of desire. Nina is strong loyal loving and is very determined to do right by herself and her friends. All while being the best farmer she can be. I loved how MAR carried through her passion for her profession and weaved it through this special love story. Nina reads Sam beautifully. She sees through him and intuitively captures the good and bad and knows how to handle him and extract his best. He's not an a$$hole around her and with her (except for a few incidents when it was mostly deliberate - they just have to be self-consciously damaged don't they? tsk tsk) and it seems as though Sam falls for her right off the bat. I've never been more surprised reading such as sudden attraction from both MCs in a contemporary story as I have in this one. But exactly for that out of formula plotting it felt more real and genuine. There are wonderful supporting characters in this of course the other Burnside siblings are among them (and I want to mention PJ because come on - the boy needs his Lacey and I need their story like air is running out) but mostly I'm talking about Tay and Rachel Nina's best friends. They completed the story arc with their part and their personality amazingly well. Also hint to MAR - I'd want to know how Tay's doing in future books. Just thought I'd share. I don't think I've ever wanted a ginger man as much as I want one now. And I know any ginger I'll meet will be automatically compared to Sam. (especially if he looks like the ginger on the cover *dies*) I think my review speaks for itself and reflects how much I loved the book but in case it didn't.... My Rating: 5 glorious stars * Loveswept/Random House is being very good to me and provided this ARC in exchange for an honest review.,1,1975-08-23 00:22:37

600,22241198,06085715,This book was a different pace from the book I normally read. Liz Adams certainly knows how to deliver erotic fiction. I really enjoyed reading this book. This book is certainly not what you would expect super hero wise but a very erotic take on Wonder Woman's daughter. This book was my first by Liz Adams and it was was promised to be sexually charged and it most certainly delivered.,1,1986-08-26 04:50:51
601,1059682,reagansu,Related short stories about the 'Eternal Family'. They have lived for centuries in a big old house in Illinois coming and going at different times where preparations are being made for a homecoming. Wonderfully written as only Ray Bradbury can these stories introduce us to the members of the family shapeshifters telepaths somnambulists vampires and A Thousand Times Great Grandmere who has been around since ancient Egypt. Originally conceived as a joint venture between Bradbury and illustrator Charles Addams the book was put on hold for many years after Addams'death but finally finished by Bradbury and published with many of Addams original drawings. Highly recommended.,5,2014-03-13 06:38:12

607,18777580,scrboy,In the end I was unable to finish this one. The writing is simply gorgeous as is always the case with Mary Ann Rivers at the helm. And I loved Sam just as much as I knew I would from his introduction in the first book in the Burnside series. The problem I had was connecting with Nina. She simply felt too slick to me (for lack of a better word). My attempts to get to know her kept slipping off her surface. And I had wanted so much more for the woman Sam needed. This imbalance got in the way of my overall enjoyment and I was forced to put it down. This is the first misstep I've had from Ms. Rivers so I will be picking up the next installment for sure.,2,1984-08-07 10:08:56
608,15156124,mhaiyerlin6390,This is the third book in the series and I haven't read the first two. Does it matter or the book is good enough to stand alone? Well till almost the end of the book it does not matter. The book is good enough to stand alone till then. But during the climax things got so confusing with me trying to figure out who is who and what happened in the past. So it's better if you read the series in order. What does the book entail? It has lots of paranormal (incubus succubus witches vampires and werewolves) romance a bit of mystery and lots of action. And ooh I forgot the psychological bit (agoraphobia). The book is mostly fast paced. So well if you are a big time paranormal fan this book is just for you. Go pick it up once you are done with the other two in the series. For me this book made for an ok read since I'm not too much into paranormal and require some more plot and action to my liking.,3,1976-09-12 17:59:21

I was not able to put his book down at all and was heart broken when it ended but was also excited to read book two and have the story continue to unfold. I would greatly suggest this book to everyone because its so worth the time. I want everyone to go out and buy this book because you are going to be taken on a ride that you will not want to get off. Take my word for it and go buy the best book of a series that you will want to read . I must say Miss Arianne Richmonde that I am one of your biggest fans and have been recommending your books to my friends and I will continue to.

610,25908407,beslangeroy,The final book in the series and one I was eager for after encountering the delightful Gavin in the earlier books and wanting him to get his own happy ending. This was a second chance romance involving a pair who knew each other from childhood with Gavin secretly loving Felicity while forced to watch her fall in love with another and now gets his chance again. This is the fourth book in a series and it is very connected to the earlier books but yet is written in a way that one could read it out of order if they didn't mind the inclusion of earlier couples. Gavin is a standing character throughout the series but this story takes up his distant past and brings in a new heroine so it is doable. The story opens with widow Lady Felicity deciding that she needs to come out of deep mourning for her husband and rejoin the world. She and her young son live with her husband's brother and his wife who are going to Bath for the annual music festival. The area of Bath was once Felicity's home and she has stayed away for years so now would be a good time to go back. It will be hard because people will bring up their feelings and sympathy but it should be alright after a time. Felicity is also eager to see her old childhood friend Gavin. They were once so close and then after her marriage he pulled away. Maybe they can have a reunion and restore their friendship. Gavin Viscount Derrington fell in love with his childhood friend Felicity. The night he picked to propose she informs him that she met a good man by chance they fell in love and are now betrothed. Gavin is heartbroken and the only thing he can do is distance himself so he doesn't have to watch the woman he loves be in love and happy with someone else. Now she's back in Bath. He thought time would change his feelings but the attraction is still there. It guts him to see her grief and having to play the friend with the strong shoulder she can cry on but he loves her enough to be what she needs him to be. Is this a second chance or is it proof that it was never meant to be? This was a daring choice for a romance plot or so it felt to me. Unrequited love is a real life possibility always. Sometimes people fall in love and their love isn't reciprocated. Since this is romantic fiction Gavin does get his second chance but there was a part of me that was saddened because even the possibility of unrequited love is crushing to a romantic like myself. But anywoo the story was engaging and touching as a result of this pair's backgrounds. I felt for Gavin with his secret love for Felicity and how he sucked it up and chose to keep going instead of crumbling under such disappointment and I also felt for Felicity having lost her husband while they are both young. She was very much in love and his collapse was unexpected. The pressure on her to move on and try again was annoying to me. I was glad her brother in law and his wife were gentle with her even if her own family was pushing her to go out and land another man. Gavin's family pushed him too but mostly out of love. Both characters were appealing and I respected them so much. I wanted them to get together and I liked how it was a gradual thing and not instant. Gavin hesitates because he already got his heart crushed and that hurt while Felicity doesn't even see them as more than good friends for the longest time and the shock of discovering it's something else causes panic and the inevitable withdrawal. Because of the nature of Felicity's situation this is not a heated and passion-filled story. More on the sweeter side for most of the book before things give way to attraction. The end came fast and I had a hard time keeping up. At first I didn't care for that but then when my emotions caught up I actually did like that the author didn't draw things out after the big conflict. The book had been building things slowly and I got a good look at what they could be like together so I guess I didn't need a drawn out denouement. So all in all I enjoyed this final book in the series. I will miss the setting of romances happening at the Bath Music Festival. I really hope the author might someday write Gavin's brother's stories. They were a fun group. I would recommend the book/series to those who enjoy slightly spicy Historical Romance. My thanks to Penguin Group for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.,3,1975-10-14 06:38:51

615,18777580,jets11,Sam doesn't want to but he volunteers at a farm to help him lighten up and release some some stress. He only does it to keep his partner quiet. Once he sets eyes on Nina that all changes. She makes him rethink things and she gets him to let go of his control. He has been hiding problems for years and constantly holding it together for everyone. He finds with Nina he can be his true self. Nina is a widow who has worked hard to get her farm going. She has a few problems of her own in her past and is afraid at times to take another chance. Sam needs her and she needs him they both just have to see they are truly perfect for each other. I liked the first book n this series but wasn't sure ow I would like Sam. He always seemed to be bossing people around to me in the first book. In this one we see another side of him. A side that needs people but really doesn't know how to say it at times. The man who is sexy but also at times you really just want to hug. He really got my heart when he wrote letters to his sister but was afraid to send them. He would really open up to her. Nina I liked her but I wouldn't say I loved her. She was nice but some reason I just couldn't connect with her. This is a heart wrenching and heartwarming story all in one. Both Nina and Sam have to open up about past losses and learn they really love each other. I love all the side characters and look forward to the next story. I fell for Sam in this one and sure the next family member has a wonderful story as well.,3,1982-04-07 08:43:26
616,5949376,paraskivairina,This is another mystery by the world's bestselling author of our time. Agatha Christie has sold over two billion copies of her novels which has been outsold only by Shakespeare and the Bible worldwide. Many of her books show on the lists of classics and many have been converted to film. This particular mystery was overly complex in that the author led you to suspect everyone in Egypt during the venture and also overdid the ending with tying up every romance in the country. This sounds critical but the truth is that you keep reading with energy and are satisfied that you finished another of Agatha Christie's great mysteries.,2,1994-12-12 08:26:27

619,18338465,blefiz1723,Wow! That is the thought that seems to be playing constantly in my head right now. I had the privileged to read the first version of this brilliant story some time ago and I just have to say Sempre is a one of a kind type of book. I couldn't help and fell in love with these characters all over again. Carmine is so lost and immature that you really think he could do some of the things he did. Haven is so pure and at the same time strong that you know she'll overcome anything through at her way. Dr. DeMarco is not always the bad guy. He has a purpose and is only trying to save everyone (his burden is really heavy to him and I almost thought he would not make it to the end). The other characters were specially made to play a great part in this realistic story and I loved them all. I just wish this didn't have to end. I cried with them LOL some and almost shoot someone because of his/her stupidity. Sempre made me think about the people out there that live their lives like Haven in Blackburn. Thanks Mrs. Darhower for this amazing book and the amazing story that was EP. I hope to see these characters again (especially Corrado and Carmine).,4,1962-09-21 05:50:09
620,18528666,nessco,I've made no secret of my general dislike of "starting in the middle of the action" as a way to begin stories. Usually "starting in the middle of the action" is just a cover for a weak beginning (at least "weak" in the eyes of some TV producer (because it's TV where we find this most often used)) and after starting as near to the climax as possible we get the inevitable "48 hours earlier." I just hate that. Seriously. Ask my wife. Any show that uses that tactic as a regular opener holds no real credibility for me. [Only very occasionally does this work for me like that episode of Firefly that opens with Mal naked and stranded. However if you're about to show me your characters handcuffed to pipe in a room filling with water for the 7th time this season please just don't.] There are ways of starting a story in media res that do work. For instance A New Hope opens with a prologue scene of of the battle above Tatooine in which Leia is captured and the droids escape to the planet. The actual exposition of the story does not begin until we switch to the introduction of Luke. That kind of thing works. It gives us background while immediately hooking us. Imagine that story starting in the trash compactor though and then flashing back to the events leading up to that. That would be horrible. Harry Potter opens the same way by the way with a prologue of the baby being taken to the Dursleys; the exposition begins when we switch to about to have a birthday Harry. [I think I read somewhere that Rowling actually wrote that first bit as a prologue but the publisher made her shift it to "chapter one."] Another way to start a story in the middle of the action is to open with a character who doesn't know what's going on. For whatever reason. Part of the point of these types of stories is to go along with the character and figure out what's happening and why. Rusty Carl does a pretty great job of that in "My Killbot Buddy." [And man that's one killer (no pun intended) cover Rusty whipped up. I think it's my favorite piece by him yet.] Not only does the protagonist wake up with no memory (for very good reason (which yes is important (because I hate the whole "oh let's have our character have amnesia" thing))) but he wakes up as... old. He doesn't remember getting old and man what a shock that would be. Oh and yeah he's the most hated man in the world. How the heck did that happen? And that's what we have to find out what our character is trying to figure out. It's an interesting discovery and the story is wide open at the end. Which is not to say that the story doesn't end because it does. But it ends in the way you would enter an airlock: one door shuts and another one opens. We're in the airlock with this story so when the other door opens you can see that there is a whole world to be explored out there but Carl doesn't take us through. What lies through that door is only what we can see with our minds. But I do hope that he comes back to this and gives us more than a peek as to what's on the other side of that door. This is a good strong "A" of a story possibly my favorite by Carl thus far.,4,1999-08-21 16:22:39
621,1059682,pokrovskywx,From The Dust Returned by Ray Bradbury is a tale of spirits inhabiting and gathering to the "House" in October Country for a "Homecoming". The chapters are new and old some being culled from various magazines where they were printed as short stories decades ago. Put together they create a hodge-podge of delightfully ethereal characters with wonderful names like "A Thousand Times Great Grandmere" and "Nostrum Paracelsius Crook". The main character Timothy is the only human in the House. A foundling with only a spider and a mouse for friends he longs to be part of the ghostly family. Some of the chapters involve the histories of the spirits that are venturing to the House. They are coming from all over the world so there are plenty of tales to tell. The truly magical thing about this book is the way some of the words flow almost hallucinatory surely poetic at times. Passages such as: "Before the tumult of wings the collision of fogs and mists and souls like ribboned smokes she saw her own soul and hungers." The chapters definitely show evidence of being written at different times therefore some are better than others. I loved the chapters that wound words around and around that tickled my brain with their playfulness! This is a book I will re-read each Halloween!,4,1996-06-10 00:13:11

He always seemed to be yelling or not speaking to his siblings. However I thought that the author effectively explains the reasons behind his behavior and makes him into what I thought was a very likeable (if impulsive moody constantly-swearing) hero . It was lovely how Nina really seemed to 'get' Sam and was not put off by his bluster. Sam and Nina's first date where both try way too hard was a hoot. Enough with harping on about Nina being middle-aged though- I think she is 38- that just made me feel old! I hope PJ and Lacey's story is next,5,1961-01-23 00:21:52

628,18777580,ksayros2,Laugh by Mary Ann Rivers ( Burnside #2) is a 2014 Loveswept publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. This second book in the Burnside series focuses on Sam. If you will recall Sam in a doctor and also suffers from ADHD. With a new health clinic about to open Sam is badgered to volunteer at a Green Space farm which he only does to get people off his back. Once he is introduced to Nina the farm's owner he begins to see the all the possibilites of organic farming. Nina is a war widow with an easy practical loyal and earthy personality that makes Sam want to laugh and enjoy life a little something he has done precious little of in his life. Nina is also dealing with a the serious illness of one of her workers that she has become close friends with. Things are fine with Nina just as long as she and Sam stay on the lusty side of things and keep all the heavy commitment issues out of it but Sam is sure about Nina and wants to take the relationship further emotionally. Nina isn't sure she can handle taking care of her friend and dealing with all of Sam's personal issues too. Again this contemporary romance is not the light and breezy type of romance novel. Each character in this book has really heavy issues to deal with and even if you do love someone it's not a bed of roses. Sam is a man that has tried to cope with all of his family's tragedies and his many mistakes plus dealing with a disorder that can lead to misunderstandings. But Sam is a very deep and emotional person that has been pretty hard on people in the past and that includes himself. He has let people down and hasn't always handled everything the best way possible but he wants to try and bridge the gap between himself and his siblings and really wants to help his sister Sarah who is still recovering from a horrible accident. Nina has dealt with her husband's death and is up front and open about her feelings but isn't sure she will be able to handle the type of relationship Sam wants. I don't know if Nina was just feeling a little rushed or if she didn't know if Sam was really serious or if she was just trying to catch up to Sam emotionally. When she does realize Sam is serious she does her own soul searching. Nina is a funny character with a lot of heart and I really liked her. I think she and Sam will be fine and maybe the family is on it's way to healing a great many hurts but there will be some really hard roads to travel yet. I think getting Sam on the right track is a huge break through. I will be honest and tell you liked this chapter in the series but not as much as the first book. I can't really explain why I didn't bond with these characters the same way I did with those in the first book but there was just something different with this one. This is still a series I am really invested in and I'm looking forward to seeing what will happen next. I will give this one 4 stars.,5,1999-02-14 19:53:12
629,10803536,katyabumerang,This is a thriller about weather manipulation causing havoc across the globe. A scientist Greg Simpson sets up a research base on Antartica called TESLA with the help of a huge agrobusiness called Flint. There Greg goes rogue and starts causing weather to wreak havoc. When Flint decides to replace him with another scientist Tess he really flips out. Tess worked for him in the past and due to the way their working relationship ended Greg hates her. So before he leaves TESLA he activates software viruses and code taht he has programmed that essentially hijacks the weather manipulation equipment and it starts sending out disasterous storms earthquakes etc. Also there are government players involved like the Pentagon who want to use TESLA for their purposes too. One of the interesting things about this novel is that it seems strangely plausible that big business the government etc could have programs with these purposes. Are some of the horrible weather events like Katrina etc really just freaks of nature storms or could they have been purposely generated? The book it entertaining and fast paced. I enjoyed it.

631,18777580,mraupp,I read so many books and many of those are what I call fluff books. They are like cotton candy which is sweet and taste good and the minute it is in your mouth it disappears. Many many books are like that for me. That is all to say THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE BOOKS! This book has so much heart so much substance that I almost don't know what to say. What a wonderful job Ms. Rivers did I writing this book. Her characters are so real and she brings them to life so well that I just want to go live with the Burnside family. I felt such a connection with Sam who has accomplished so much but who is so flawed with coping with ADHD. When you have lived with someone who has ADHD and you probably have some of that yourself you know when the writing is real. I loved how the relationship between Nina and Sam developed but mostly I love all the continuing characters that we see in these books. The relationships among the Burnside siblings feel so real and true that I cannot wait for the next book to be written. I hope that Ms Rivers is well on her way with the next one. Thanks to the author the publisher and Netgalley for giving me the opportunity to live once again with the Burnside family.,4,2003-11-15 09:01:14
632,17793409,zakiabdelwahed,Resena originalmente publicada en: http://www.desvandesuenos.com/2013/06... Lo primero que me llamo la atencion de la novela es la portada que me parece super mona y su peculiar titulo. No es algo a lo que estemos acostumbrados o al menos yo ya que en el genero romantico no solo el principe azul no le da la patada a la princesa sino que cuida de ella la salva y la rescata. Pero esto no es una novela es la realidad. He leido algunos libros de ?autoayuda? (tampoco es que haya leido muchisimos) la mayoria de Jorge Bucay porque me gustan las historias con moraleja con alguna ensenanza detras. Son de esas lecturas para saborear lentamente esos libros que dan paz despues de leerlos. Pero no me gustan los manuales de instrucciones por eso me ha encantado el estilo de Rosetta: ameno cautivador ligero e ingenioso. Ademas nos ofrece una vision de las relaciones desde el punto de vista masculino: sus inseguridades sus filias y fobias los valores y las creencias preestablecidas a los que tienen que enfrentarse en las relaciones amorosas. El protagonista es Reynaldo y gracias a los consejos y la sabiduria de Hada va encaminando sus pasos hacia donde realmente quiere. Es curioso leer cliches y "cosas que son asi" en los que normalmente no se repara conscientemente pero que realmente estan muy arraigados en la sociedad y afectan tremendamente a las relaciones entre hombres y mujeres. Nos presenta todo tipo de situaciones algunas simples anecdotas mientras que otras son el reflejo de duras realidades a traves de personajes como princesas de diadema floja reinas principes que no existen y sapos que ojala no existieran. No es para nada una critica contra las mujeres ni contra los hombres es una representacion de determinadas personas que se comportan de una forma poco sana cuando estan en relaciones de pareja. En mi opinion nos ofrece una vision equilibrada e igualitaria del amor.,5,1965-06-20 21:22:30

I guess when you read a book by 54% and you stall it for almost an year you must be true to yourself and admit it : you won't ever go back to this book.

641,18338465,superw,Ma con una sinossi del genere poi perche tale J. M. Darhower a un certo punto manda tutto in vacca? Partiamo con ordine.. Come detto nella trama Haven e una schiava di seconda generazione ovvero la figlia di una schiava mentre Carmine il figlio del Dr. DeMarco cioe colui che compra 'salva' Haven dalla schiavitu I due si incontrano a casa dei DeMarco casa che diventa di conseguenza anche di Haven anche se sente il dovere di comportarsi ancora come schiava probabilmente anche perche confusa dal Dr. DeMarco che e tutto un 'non sei piu in schiavitu'/'la cena deve essere pronta tutte le sere entro le 19'. Probabilmente sarei confusa anche io. Qui si avvicinano Haven & Carmine piano piano con delicatezza e gentilezza in modo guardingo anche perche lei e troppo molto fragile anche per colpa della vita che le e stata riservata. Ma veniamo a noi... Una qualita che all'inizio mi ha fatto apprezzare tantissimo questo libro e stata la lentezza. Quel tipo di lentezza che ti fa gustare la trama i personaggi gli stati d'animo quel tipo di lentezza che ti fa pensare 'oh finalmente un libro che si prende i suoi spazi che ti fa entrare pian piano nei meccanismi e che non ti rigurgita tutto addosso'. A un certo punto pero ragazzi dai una mossa! Sono arrivata a un punto verso meta libro che volevo mollare stava diventando di un tedioso assurdo... Sentivo che l'autrice voleva arrivare a un punto ma non capivo quale fosse Sentivo nell'aria puzza di bugie e segreti ma mai un indizio.. Inoltre piu leggevo e piu i personaggi mi stavano sulle balle a parte Dominic fratello di Carmine. Avevo davvero zero empatia per i protagonisti. Haven tutta un SORRY ogni due parole. personalita zero praticamente un robot nelle mani di Carmine. Carmine tutto un 'relax baby'/'grab me some food' discorsi noioserrimi scene banali sti due che fanno pisolini dalla mattina alla sera. Non si vedono per settimane e al ritorno lui la prima cosa che pensa e 'facciamo un pisolino'. Per me e no. "La mia bella ragazza" he said. "Napping in the afternoon?" "I ran out of stuff to do" she said. "Everything's clean." He sighed. "A nap actually sounds good right now." Anche se in realta Carmine aveva davvero tutte le carte in regola per essere un best boyfriend book e innanzitutto figo protettivo really bad womanizer (forse anche un po' troppo cliche) ma a volte mi e sembrato un po' idiota.. Quindi no grazie. Parlando dei personaggi probabilmente mi sono piaciuti piu quelli secondari in primis Dominic come accennato e il padre il Dr DeMarco. Un altro personaggio rivelazione e stato lo zio Corrado. La storia ha davvero del potenziale infatti dall'80% in poi diventa fighissima e piena di colpi di scena uno via l'altro iniziano a svelarsi segreti complotti trappole. DI TUTTO. Ricordiamoci che e pur sempre un crime book pero ecco un bel 30% del libro io l'avrei tagliato lasciando comunque 400pagg belle e buone. Non so se leggero il secondo libro Sempre - Redemption probabilmente visto il finale credo di si pero boh Che noia. PS perche gli autori si ostinano a creare personaggi italiani mafiosi che parlano un italiano orribile? Ci sono frasi che non stanno ne in cielo ne in terra. Poi Carmine che chiama Haven 'la mia bella ragazza' a me sa tanto di viscido di complimento fatto per strada. Sono esagerata io?! Probabile.,3,1972-09-29 03:44:35
642,27384500,habe739,Follow Me by Angela Clarke is published by Avon. The ebook is out on 3 December 2015 followed by the paperback on 31 December 2015. Social Media; Twitter Facebook WhatsApp Snapchat Instagram .... the home of arguments feuds debate. A platform to connect with people just like you or to haunt those that are the opposite. A place to make friends or enemies. Social Media: the biggest change in how we live our lives how we talk to each other how we learn things. Online ..... where no one can hear you scream. Follow Me is a story that could haunt any Twitter user it will make you think about who you are online and who can see you. It could change your habits. Freddie is an investigative journalist. No actually Freddie would like to be an investigative journalist. Whilst she's waiting for her big break she's working in a coffee bar and writing a column for an online news site. Freddie's life revolves around her phone. She wakes up everyday and checks her screen; what's happening on Twitter who has sent her a WhatsApp. Freddie's life is a bit of a disaster; she hates her boss she sleeps on a ratty sofa she lives with a gang of people who she doesn't really know she has casual sex with random guys that she meets online. Freddie needs a story that will show the world that she IS somebody she needs a scoop something that nobody has got. When Freddie bumps into her old friend Nasreen her memories catapult her back to better days. She remembers her childhood how strong their friendship was. They shared secrets they were solid. But something happened to change that and now Nasreen is a police officer and Freddie is on the scrap heap. And then bang. The action starts. There's a murder and it's being played out on Twitter. The Hashtag Murderer is taunting the police. The number of people following the murderer increases by the hour and the body count rises too. If there is anyone who can help the police it's Freddie and she soon finds herself smack bang in the middle of the investigation as the police Social Media Advisor .... and the chase is on. Angela Clarke's writing is taunt dark and bang on the mark. She has managed to get deep into the world of Social Media and delivered a story that is up to date compelling and absolutely fascinating. Freddie is an unconventional character so far away from the usual lead character in crime novels but so well developed. Alongside the hunt for the #Hashtag Murderer the reader is transfixed by the relationship between Freddie and Nasreen. The mystery of their childhood friendship an its abrupt ending permeates this story and exposes Freddie's more vulnerable and softer side. I have no idea whether a police force would really take on an unknown to become such an integral part of a high profile murder case and I'm not really bothered because for me Follow Me is a refreshing new look at police procedure and crime fiction on the whole. There are moments when my heart beat so fast that I actually felt quite sick the author hooks you and reels you in and it is almost impossible to get this story out of your head. Twists and turns a plenty. This is a totally gripping and engrossing story. I'd recommend it highly. http://randomthingsthroughmyletterbox...,1,1981-07-11 16:29:43

645,32713517,j1opus,This was a great book. I think I liked it better than Wonder Woman Unbound. Catwoman just has a more interesting history (no offense Diana). Hanley has some stand out moments such as when he rips Bob Kane a new one for lying about Bill Finger's involvement in Batman's creation or when he takes Hollywood to task for letting Catwoman (2004) kill female led superhero movies for over a decade when male superhero flops keep on trucking. Even if you're not really into comics I think you'd find this enjoyable. And Hanley does a good job of breaking things down so that even if you're not a comics person you can understand the context.,2,1976-07-24 21:20:06
646,22241198,matveev74,Ariel Garrison is nothing like the Wonder Woman character in comic books--no tiara no bracelets no magic rope and no invisible plane--but she does have superhuman strength a secret she must guard with her life as she spends her graduating year in St. Petersburg Russia in a foreign exchange program. Planning to work for the CIA Ariel has one guiding rule: never fall in love. Doing so could give her enemies leverage and put her lover's life in jeopardy. A thoroughly enjoyable completely erotic romp! I started reading at 11 PM figuring I'd read for a half hour and then go to sleep. Finally at 3 AM I forced myself to put my Kindle down. (A girl has to sleep after all!) Yes it's that good. Ariel is emotionally lost and it's very clear to the reader that what she desires most is love and a committed relationship. However due to her past she's rightly terrified of putting those she loves in danger. Yet this deep desire is what guides her choices even the choices that lead her away from intimacy. Ariel's internal conflict was so well written that I found my heart breaking for her. The hero Pasha is flat in comparison to Ariel. However he is likable and his desire for Ariel is clear. Since the focus of the narrative is on Ariel the lack of character development of the hero isn't a distraction. My biggest complaint is that this should have been a full-length novel. The end is rushed and the conclusion is too neatly concocted. It's a "wham bam thank you ma'am" type of ending. This would have been fine if it were just an erotic story. However this is mainly a romance. Well I like my endings to romance stories more drawn out just the way love making should be. I've read most of Liz Adam's stories and her writing just keeps getting better and better. Ariel's Dangerous Liaisons is the first genuine erotic romance she's written (as opposed to just erotica) and she's done a great job at developing the romantic elements. Since I'm a romance junkie I appreciated the emotional journey of the heroine. I look forward to Liz's next story!,3,1958-11-22 23:39:53
647,31691978,kfgjxrfdthecmrf,A follow up to one of my all-time favorites this book of shorter tales can't completely measure up but it's still worth reading. "The Hole in the Sky" is one of the most disturbing stories I've read which ordinarily wouldn't result in a positive review from me but Richard Adams has a remarkable ability to mix beauty and pathos with a surprising gritty darkness. You quickly forget that you're reading about rabbits yet they never feel anthropomorphized. Adams builds an entire society with its own believable fascinating mythology.,4,2012-04-23 09:53:51
648,27384500,qbuenicimo18,This is a really good modern crime novel. It's really nice to see a book that properly reflects the modern world and how the technologies in the modern world are used. I tend to get really frustrated with books that ignore the worlds of Twitter and Facebook completely or only make passing reference to them or try to shoehorn them in in a way that makes them feel totally awkward and disingenuous. Follow Me isn't like that. The main character Freddie is a struggling writer who decides to follow an old friend who is now a police officer on a whim and ends up getting sucked into a case about a serial killer. The murders appear to be linked to social media usage and so she is brought on to be a social media consultant. The police try to solve the crime whilst she advises them on what digitally the so-called Hashtag Murderer could mean by his cryptic tweets. The whole book is a really fun read - Freddie and school friend Nasreen are both well-rounded and likable characters even when they're behaving pretty badly. It's fairly light hearted but Clarke doesn't shy away from gory depictions of brutal murders or the black psychological way that the case affects Freddie without seeming gratuitous at any time. In short really loved Follow Me and am looking forward to the next one!,3,1992-09-12 02:19:02

653,23626289,roledog,So spannend so herzzerreissend so gut! Die Arbeit des Autors Sie hat alles richtig gemacht. Armentrout schreibt nicht nur wahnsinnig humorvoll und auf eine angenehme Art und Weise - nein sie schafft es gleichzeitig auch noch Spannung zu erzeugen die einen fast schon dazu zwingt Kapitel fur Kapitel weiterzulesen.

655,2168737,PAULBELL,I originally bought this comic as monthly issues then again as a TPB and I'm just sorry that the series didn't continue for longer. Dan Slott is a great writer: he clearly relishes obscure continuity and this comic involves several guest appearances from other Marvel superheroes. At the same time it's not involved in any big crossovers so it stands alone as a complete story. Beyond that there's a real sense of fun and the characters genuinely seem to like spending time with each other. I liked Civil War but at the same time it's good to see a friendly game of poker rather than brutal fights to the death. Similarly the Thing is determined that they can all get out of Arcade's "Murderworld" without anyone dying; compare and contrast to Avengers Arena... There are some very funny scenes in this particularly involving Lockjaw. It's also good to see the GLX again and Squirrel Girl's team-up was great. I've never been a huge fan of the Fantastic Four but they come across well in this: in particular Reed gets to display his intelligence rather than us being told that he's smart. (He gave a very clear explanation of the "phone number with missing digits" problem.) The artwork is good too. It's quite cheerful but still detailed enough to show the characters' emotions. The cast have a range of body types and lots of them are wearing normal clothes rather than skin-tight outfits so I'm glad that Andrea DiVito has the range to pull it off. All in all thoroughly recommended.,2,2002-05-25 06:46:15
656,15710450,teddybal65,Tells the painting life of Henri rousseau in picture book form. He was 40 years old when he taught himself to paint and he persevered through exhibitions where his work was roundly criticized as immature; well he had no formal training and his style is "naive" and used flattened shapes and unrealistic scenes that were later copied by modern painters. I love the illustrations in this book they're so colorful and whimsical and done in a style that very closely resembles Rousseau's art and there are two double-page spreads of groups of chracters who are actually famous people whom Rousseau knew. The illustrator includes a great key in the back to point out exactly who is who. I didn't know anything about Rousseau (not that I could remember from college art history anyway) and this was a very enlightening book. No bibliography or list of further reading.,3,2007-11-07 23:56:23
657,1059682,awpebash,As usual with Bradbury the language and images here are really lovely and evocative. The story in this case is somewhat uneven and I was disappointed by how little was made of the intriguing tidbits and references to mysterious characters and events. Part of the problem is that this is really a collection of tales featuring the same characters but written over a period of years and published separately and so there are inconsistencies changes in tone and hints of stories which might have been developed and then weren't. Still there are a few really excellent stories and they all have some delightful elements.,1,1955-11-10 18:52:50

659,6670541,BigLar,** spoiler alert ** Inspector Singh strikes again! I guess the writer is trying very hard to make us fell in love with the plump overbearing brilliant detective but certainly he's not endearing like that famous fat Belgian detective I love so much..Hercule Poirot. Ironically I feel sorry for the murderer instead. We all can understand her plight. It reminds me of that scene from the infamous movie; Gone With the Wind when Scarlett pronounced that she'll "lie steal cheat or kill as God as my witness I'll never be hungry again". I feel kind of sorry for her you know..she's been through a lot..it's not surprising that she turned out to be a murderer. Ops..I'm giving out hints that the murderer is indeed a SHE. So there's too many suspects for once because the victim; a senior partner in a law firm knows to much. There's his seductress Fillippino wife his vengeful Botox ladden ex-wife a gay Indian partner a drug addict White partner two partners having an affair..phew..the murderer turned out to be the nicest one of the lot! Inspector Singh is very bad tempered this time. He bullied that nice Corporal Fongshout to the other uniforms being particularly rebellious towards his boss..dear me..I'm not sure I like him very much. He only feared his wife with her non-stop clucking cooking and gossiping. I know he's supposed to be witty and smart and an expert on human nature but I think it's just that fortunately he got a lucky break that prove his hunches are right.,3,1992-01-07 01:50:51

662,15156124,kawboy88,First before I start with the character analysis this was an incredibly creative story. I was really impressed with the creation myths centered around each species. They were very unique and I LOVE unique. This book had a little bit of everything including a very entertaining and funny witch! Fiona has a fear of the outside and it goes deeper than the birds telling her something bad is going to happen if she goes outside. On her routinely stressful everyday trip to the mailbox Fiona hears a cry. Having the gift that allows her to communicate with animals she is at first confused when she can't get a read on it. Then she realizes its young and doesn't have a good enough grasp on the language to tell Fiona whats going on. No sooner does she take it in the house than she is attacked bu....a panther? No! Its a shifter. Fiona acts fast to try and communicate with him. But when Z reveals his human form to her nothing can keep her eyes from devouring the splendid display of flesh!! Z is a bachelor and he wants to keep it that way. Every since he stumbled on the pup his life has been in an uproar. He just wants things to go back to normal and this witch may be the ticket he is looking for! And the pup likes her! But its more than her smell that attracts Z. But his life was going to go back to normal one way or another! So we have a witch a moody bacheloresk shifter and a puppy. And this is only the beginning. There are several stories going on simultaneously and the plot ever thickens. My favorite character is Cain and just wait until you find out who he is!! This is the third book in the series but I had no problem following it. I thought this book was delightful and can't wait to sample another taste of this series! Excellent read!!,1,2010-11-08 09:06:36
663,16110527,farzi,This book was great in the sense that it had a surprise ending an unlikely hero and a totally unforeseen villain. The description was amazing pulling me into Travis' despairing life in the mines as if I were there. I do realize I don't have much of a concept of what the characters look like but when something was very important like that glass of water or the mountain of coal Miss Pennington described it just like she was there. I continued to read the book just to find out what happened because I had no idea what exactly was going on. I did however have a hard time rating this book for two reasons. First I found the violence (inevitable to a town in the Old West) too graphic. There is a painful reality of violence in this world but the grossness of it all is not something to be reveled in. Also I found the book to be more moralistic than Christian--meaning that although the characters saw murder as wrong because God says so it seemed to matter more to them that their father said it was wrong. There were times when their Christianity seemed to come out more but I'm not sure any of them ever prayed to God for help. Also Travis' reason for hope was that Ross might be able to save him and reason for going on was his father's words to "never give up". This book was enjoyable as a mystery but I would not recommend it for younger or more sensitive readers.,4,2008-02-06 12:53:02

665,23442272,chrisgbee2,Ci sono storie che aspettano decenni prima di trovare una voce che abbia voglia di raccontarle. Storie sepolte in un passato talmente intriso di dolore e sofferenza che la memoria familiare per difendersi tiene con cura nascoste ai margini dell'oblio. Fino a quando si palesano per una parola sfuggita di bocca un nome evocato per sbaglio una foto sbiadita che spunta fuori da un album polveroso e allora pretendono un interprete un portavoce uno speleologo che riporti alla luce gli scomparsi i sommersi: perche a quel punto diventano storie "necessarie" anzi storie che hanno nella feroce urgenza di questa necessita la loro unica ragion d'essere.

671,32732823,Antonieth15,* Read more of my reviews at Whoo Gives A Hoot * I generously received an ARC from Melissa Pearl's Advance Readers Team (Jordan Ford) in exchange for an honest review... I've been a longtime fan of author Melissa Pearl and her Songbird series. So you can imagine my surprise when she released The Big Play series under the pen-name Jordan Ford. Before I knew it I was quickly one-clicking them as soon as they were released. I devoured this series so fast that I was left wanting more from this extraordinary author. When The Brotherhood Trilogy was announced I jumped at the opportunity to join Melissa Pearl's Advanced Readers Team and receive an early released ARC. Can we say triple threat anyone? I absolutely loved everything about this book from the cover and title to the characters to the closing paragraph. See No Evil (Brotherhood #1) was the perfect start to another amazing series. Since I don't want to give away too much of the story I'll give you a brief outline. The story begins with Christiana on the run from her family after she witnessed something that she shouldn't have. In hiding at the Eton Preparatory School for Boys she must learn to sacrifice her life for justice. Christiana ("Ana" and "Chris") soon finds herself running towards something when she meets Trey - the boy that will change everything. I already can't wait for the next book in the series! I strongly encourage you to pick up your very own copy of this latest release. It's simple...trust me. Just go and one-click buy on Amazon. Go on..do it...you know you want to!,4,1954-02-25 15:35:38

673,16130164,3ziazila,Braine's Talk Supe review BLOOD PIPER has more heart in its story compared to Caged Warrior's brawn. The tension between Tallis and Kavya has been palpable from the start and though they're both Dragon Kings the fact that they belong to different clans made things extra spicy and interesting. Not only that the sibling rivalry (an understatement) between Kavya and Pashka and the repercussions of their tiff gave this novel a bloody edge. The battle between Tallis' family and Pashka's black guards was very dramatic and the latter's final confrontation with Kavya was bittersweet. I have a weird love affair with this series mainly because I'm itching for LPiper to reveal her secrets. I want instant gratification in that I want to know what who and where did her Kings come from and why they're called Dragon Kings when they're not shifters and there are no dragons in sight. I realize that I'm probably taking things too literally but this lack of knowledge is really putting me on the edge. There's still so much to learn about these Dragon Kings and with every book we quickly discover that LPiper's world is beyond complicated with sub-plots running as deep and elaborate as the main plot. And although things firm up slowly with each book I feel like LPiper builds her world as she goes along and we're left with a braintease trying to ascertain the origins of these Dragon Kings. Nevertheless I recommend this series with its vivid world-building cryptic myth and one-of-a-kind plot I'm sure LPiper's series will remain in your thoughts long after you're done with the novels.,4,1989-07-29 14:42:05
674,27384500,242233,4.5 Stars Follow Me is a very cleverly crafted intelligent thriller that raises very valid contemporary points about social media. Would you follow someone who appears to be the #Murderer just to see what they are up to? Would you ignore them and what happens if that user follows you? Freddie is a wannabe journalist desperate for her big break so she can stop working in a coffee shop on the night shift and to be paid for her writing. When she spots her former good friend in a station she reacquaints herself with Nasreen. She knows Nasreen is now a police officer and so she follows and ends up at a crime scene and then later attempting to help the police since she understands social media. Not only does Freddie understand social media but seems able to notice and solve the cryptic clues being posted by the twitter account that she is positive is the murder. But how can she get the police force to start believing her or taking her seriously. Follow Me shows just how powerful twitter can be and also gives hints at various ways you can make your virtual footprint a bit less traceable. As a bit of a geek I found the technical talk very interesting and could follow it all as it made sense. It is very believable and scary that a user could be conducting murders and taunting the police on twitter and the amount of people who initially doesn't take it seriously and thinks its highly amusing until the death count rises. At which point the expected public outrage may occur. With regards the murders themselves I had no clue who was hiding behind the twitter account and up until the last second I still didn't have a clue. The final reveal did make sense though it just wasn't an outcome I had thought of. There is quite a bit of police station action in Follow Me especially as the police are struggling with this case and I love seeing how police theories pan out. I found that for the most part this book didn't get under my skin the way I was hoping it would do I wasn't overly scared and oddly I wasn't put off from using twitter which I had thought may have been an outcome before reading it. I thought it took a while to get going but all the time it was building suspense and I was always curious to see what would happen next. By the last quarter I couldn't put it down. I believe this is Angela Clarke's debut thriller and its a brilliant story and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. Definitely an author with a promising future if Follow Me is anything to go by. Thanks to Netgalley and Avon for this review copy. This was my honest opinion.,2,1964-11-13 16:37:22

676,29917657,armanserow,Book - Bespoke Author - Megan McFerren and Val Prozorova Star rating - No. of Pages - 46 Cover - Nice but simple POV - 3rd person present tense dual POV Would I read it again - No. Genre - LGBT Contemporary MM Insta-Love ** COPY RECEIVED THROUGH NETGALLEY ** For me this story just wasn't my cup of tea. There wasn't enough plot not enough chemistry and basically not something that tickles my fancy. The characters were quite honestly horrendous. Never in my life have I disliked main characters so quickly. Both Ethan and Vance are egotistical full of themselves and completely unlikeable in all the ways that matter. Together they had no chemistry; they simply argued and acted like they hated each other when they were together but the minute they were alone they began fantasizing about one another. Yet they'd only met once for about half an hour at the most. Don't even get me started on how unprofessional and rude Ethan was for a business man. He kept complaining about not being able to make rent but maybe if he didn't swear every other word right in front of his customers or treat them like second class citizens then he'd get more custom and be able to afford his rent. Not only was there insta-love which isn't my thing but the tense was so frustrating. I have never read 3rd person present tense before but it is definitely not something that agrees with me. The whole story was confusing to read with most things in past tense until it mentioned the characters actions which completely jarred with the flow. But on top of that the story read more like story notes than a cohesive story. I just couldn't enjoy the writing style at all; it sounds cruel but it felt a little lazy. As though the proper care wasn't being taken to make it flow better. It was a little racist and stereotypical in places both with the Bengali taxi driver and the way Vance's Britishness was used to somehow justify his arrogant nature. Being Scottish - and British - it's a little insulting to see us all being interpreted as rude ignorant and thinking ourselves better than everyone else. Within the story there was a lack of transition between events or placement of items while there was a whole lot of fancy-schmancy talk that wasn't necessary and just felt a little forced. Somehow Ethan knows things about Vance that he shouldn't with absolutely no explanation of how. There were also places where it read like omni-present because there were too many "he's" and not enough clarification of who was thinking feeling or doing what. I also wasn't sure why the "several months later" epilogue was needed. It didn't add anything to the story except to show how weird the couple acted together and that they thought arguing was a form of flirtation.,4,1989-07-15 04:54:21
677,32606520,altindish,This book touches on a number of topics through the story and you see how the characters touch on them. Jess Bentley did a really good job incorporating them into the storyline without them seeming out of place. She created characters that each have their own flaws and they see some piece of themselves in each other. The story is thought provoking and alluring at all at the same time. I read this book within several hours as I wanted to see what obstacles each had to face/overcome to get to the end finale. It did not disappoint.,2,1990-01-27 14:20:33
678,18338465,mirashi99i,Gag me with a wooden fucking spoon. I apologize but what the fuck is wrong with people? On what gassy apocalyptic planet does a book like this deserve a 4+ star rating? The author is absolutely incapable of stringing together a sentence that isn't trite. Everyone shouts! Always! And I would dare someone to find me characters who are flatter more uninteresting and useless. A girl Haven has been born into human trafficking. She's freed by a man who buys her. Notice the irony. That man has a son. That son is the high school quarterback. The dad has tried to keep his son out of the mafia's grip but alas the day will soon come when the son will need to rise to accept his destiny. Of course the son falls in love with the new household slave. Of course he's irrationally possessive. Of course she's eventually kidnapped. Of course she has a shiny destiny of her own. I am simply in awe of how utterly terrible this story is. This is not good writing. This is not even bad writing. The writing in this book should be considered offensive to anyone with a modicum of taste and if I were an evil nasty dictator who did evil nasty things I would make it my life's work to erase this book from existence. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing that people in the world were gobbling this up and enjoying it. I could give you further details why this book sucked so hard but I'm not going to waste the energy to type it out. No one in this book does a single thing that makes any sense. There is not one spark of literary merit to a single chapter. I'm angry with myself that I wasted minutes of my life flipping through the pages. Please don't read this. Please. Run the other direction.,1,2016-06-30 01:36:14
679,32732823,cgrimes,Blood isn't necessarily thicker than water.... When Christiana/Ana finds herself in an all boys boarding school under the guise of "Chris" she couldn't be more miserable. How do you pretend to be a boy especially when there's a psychotic bully chasing after you at every turn? It doesn't matter that she tries to keep to herself it always ends in disaster until she meets Trey and his "Wolf Pack". The four of them share a bond each having inner demons they struggle to overcome. In this wonderful story of love friendship and loyalty the foursome head off on a series of deadly adventures. Will they be able to protect Chris? You have to read and find out! I was completely drawn into this book from the beginning. The characters are so well developed I wanted to jump right in and protect Chris myself. I felt as if I was part of the book itself...it's that well written. It's definitely a must-read an worthy of a 5 star review!,5,1997-01-27 17:30:16

681,18338465,hest66,I read this book about 4 years ago and gave it 1 star. A couple of weeks ago I have the pleasure to read another spin-off to this series and I absolutely love it. I then proceeded to read Made which is the story about Corrado and needless to say I adore it as well. I thought I will give this book another go coz enough time has passed and maybe after getting to know about the background I will change my mind and give it a higher rating. But oh boy was I wrong! I now understand why I gave this book 1 star in the first place. It's because of Carmine (hero) who is spoilt bad-tempered and generally an asshole. Throughout the book (I didn't finish it mind you) I wish I can go inside the book and just slap and slammed his head on the wall and watch him bleed to death. I think the only character that I adore is Vincent and of course Corrado. Why can't sempre be a story about Vincent and how he find another true love and they live happily ever after? Or about Corrado and Celia finally have kids and they also live happily ever after. But nope it has to be about that stupid idiot asshole Carmine who doesn't even deserve a book. This review will be a reminder to me to not reread this book ever again.,4,2015-02-28 13:49:47

683,18338465,THROTTLE,Sempre was okay in my opinion. Something that bothered me was there was no real build up of the relationship between Haven and Carmine. It went from them being strangers to being in a relationship. Some of the moments between them were cliche and cheesy. I also thought it was unrealistic that Carmine and Dominic didn't seem super curious as to why a teenage girl was now living with them- at least at first. The middle of the book seemed to drag on. Nothing was truly happening besides Haven adjusting to a normal lifestyle. There wasn't anything special or unique. I think the novel had more potential. I did however like the author's writing style and it had a way of sucking me in and made me feel like I was there myself. The last quarter of the book was really really good.,1,2011-04-18 12:00:05
684,12349665,sethpinas,After a bit too banal and ill-paced "Everybody's Song" the weakest volume so far Noki Urasawa compensates and delivers one of the best volumes so far. "Humanity in the Balance" is a roller coaster ride that clearly starts going full gear towards the finale just two volumes away not counting the sequel duology "21st Century Boys". Again I was reading this out of breath so completely intense the writing is. It's still a true marvel how urgent and real Urasawa makes his storytelling feel. In just the space of a few pages he manages to create scenes that are devastatingly touching. There is just so much of everything in this book and the challenge of holding all the various storylines together in your head is a titillating one. I'm dizzy with excitement anticipation deduction and emotion that I was put through in the course of this book. It was such a powerful experience from beginning to the marvelous end. At this point I'm so sad to know that soon it will all be over. What will I read when this perfection ends?,2,2001-11-22 09:58:04
685,12349663,ksyushakostko,There are not that many volumes left in the "20th Century Boys" saga which is why it's just a little bit concerning that the weakest volume so far comes at this point. I already felt that in the previous volume "Everybody's Song" the storyline of a returning familiar messiah was a tad banal. As the title would suggest "The Man Who Came Back" continues with just that storyline and the banality is still there. I also felt that as Urasawa has so far paced his storytelling perfectly either offering baffling plot advancement or contemplating character content- or an ingeniously crafted combination of both- this volume lags a bit draws dramatic moments a bit too far. This is still a solid compelling volume but I hope that this uncannily brilliant series doesn't lose some of its fumes as it gradually draws to a close.,1,2001-03-14 09:30:42

I love being a fast reader sometimes because now I get to move on to the next one! Okay so All The Things We Lost was super cute story with memorable characters.

688,16130164,daoneny,It always makes me think when paranormal authors - most of which are series - don't first analyze what works about the most popular series in the genres. With most of them the reasons for the success for long lines of fans waiting anxiously for any tidbit for the hype producing itself is crystal clear. Yet when a really talented author doesn't look at what makes them so special I am always surprised.... Tallis of Pendray is a Dragon King with a Berserker talent. He has been exiled from his clan for twenty years and there are parts of his past for which he is deeply ashamed. For two decades now Tallis's desire for peace among the Dragon King clans has made him a target. He was the target for an evil to invade his mind in his dreams seduce him and pull him to commit unspeakable acts. His earliest acts made him an exile to the Dragon Kings. Labelled a Heretic he was willing to be the scapegoat for the greater good until the Sun the seductress in his dreams forced him to hurt his beloved niece. From that point on Tallis looked for revenge and redemption rather than to try to work for the greater good. This desire lead him to the door of the Sun - an Indranan priestess who leads a cult like following and who has the face of his tormentor.

689,27384500,1960ChevyBelair,This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life. This book did something that I honestly did not think was even possible for me. When I started the book I wasn't connecting with it at all. I was having such a problem with it that I seriously considered not finishing it about a third of the way through. The story just wasn't clicking for me. I decided to read a bit more....and the impossible happened....I couldn't put it down. I can't remember this happening to me before this book. I ended up liking the story quite a bit in the end. I made the decision to read this story because the idea of it just really appealed to me. A murderer that spends their time online. Wow. I spend way too much time online so the idea behind this book is actually quite scary to be honest. We all know that the internet can be a dangerous place and this story sounded like it could be pulled for the headlines someday soon. Freddie is a struggling journalist trying to jump start her career. When she runs into her childhood friend Nasreen who is now with the police she hopes that she might have found her big break. Freddie is much more savvy with technology than any of the members of the police force and soon finds herself working to help catch a killer as a social media consultant. The stakes are high and she soon realizes that the most important thing is to catch the killer before it is too late. Once the mystery really gained momentum in the book I was hooked. All of the Twitter clues paired with regular police work really keep things interesting. I think that the way the police were divided over the importance of social media in this case was really well portrayed. The group of police were really interesting characters together. The frustration they all felt when things went poorly was intense and I thought that the author did a great job of showing their layers and complexity. I do have to say that I didn't like Freddie in a lot of ways. I think that may be why the first part of the book was so hard for me to get into. She makes a lot of really bad decisions and doesn't always work well with the rest of the team. I disliked her less by the end of the book but I wouldn't say that I ever grew to like her. The relationship between Nasreen and Freddie was hard to figure out. The build up as to what happened in their past was intense. I really expected a lot of fireworks when the truth was revealed. The reality was a small firework that didn't have a lot of long lasting effects. Once it was out in the open it wasn't really as much of an issue as I had expected. I would recommend this book to others. I think that my inability to connect with the story at the beginning was really more me than the book. This is the first book by Angela Clark that I have had a chance to read and I look forward to see what else she comes up with in the future. I received an advance reader edition of this book from HarperCollins UK Avon via NetGalley for the purpose of providing an honest review. Initial Thoughts Slow start but once it picked up I didn't want to put it down. I don't think that I have ever enjoyed a book that I almost gave up on like this one.,1,1976-12-01 09:19:24

697,3882435,hillbillytattoo,Bradbury has a very different writing style than most contemporary authors but I found that I enjoyed the looser prose and liberal use of symbolism.

699,12383580,dammpill,There is so much going on in this book that the storyline gets lost in the midst of it all. It could do with an edit for flow and the plot needs to be reined in. I would suggest a glossary of names and places. Perhaps even a map and a family tree but in the back to avoid any spoilers. The genealogy within the storyline is complex and I would venture to say it complicates the plot instead of making it clearer hence the need for a tree. This is something that other authors have done on occasion especially when they write epic novels. It is a very ambitious piece of work that just needs a little shake of the branches to clean out the dead leaves. I can clearly see the energy and vaste amount of creativity the author can bring to the table in a lucid yarn spinning way which is evident predominantly in the first and last quarter of the book. Hopefully that will become more structured centred and solid in the next books.,4,1952-10-19 19:08:50
700,11827783,jariheikkila,I liked the art quite a bit. The story was pretty good. The only flaw for me was that the characterizations for Watson & Holmes felt a bit off at times.

702,18777580,oyster33,"Their hearts had let the laughter soften them into reckless intimacies." (Kindle Location 258) Laugh is the second of Mary Ann Rivers' The Burnside Series novels that focus on a set of four orphaned adult siblings Sam Destiny Sarah and PJ Burnside from Lakefield Ohio. I reviewed Live in January. Many locations and supporting characters in Laugh also appeared in Live. While you will have a fuller experience if you have read Live it is not necessary to do so in order to read and love Laugh. Laugh is Dr. Sam Burnside's story. In Live Sam is Destiny's older over-bearing asshole doctor brother and I absolutely hated him. I was actually hoping Ms. Rivers would write PJ or Sarah's story first and leave Sam to the end because even though Des still loved the grump I wasn't looking forward to spending time especially if was going to continue to unintentionally upset everyone in his life with his nagging and micro-managing. Sam and his childhood friend Lacey are about to open a community clinic in their neighborhood. The opening is weeks away and Sam's intense yet unfocused energy has become more and more of a distraction as they struggle to jump through the remaining bureaucratic hoops. Lacey sends Sam to Nina an urban farmer and cafe owner in the neighborhood under the guise of cultivating community connections and collaboration. Sam stomps into one of Nina's urban plots angry and out-of-sorts and he is quickly disarmed by Nina's humor and distracted by her beauty. "Her eyebrow arched up again waiting for him to get his thumb out of his ass he supposed. So was he. He briefly considered a conciliatory measure and polite reintroduction of himself and his mission there and then quickly settled on fuck that." (Kindle Loc 118-119) The Sam Burnside in Laugh is very recognizably the Sam Burnside from Live. He has not received a personality transplant making him nicer less over-bearing or easier to get along with. He might in fact be even more flawed in Laugh. Yet by the second chapter I found myself rooting for him in a way I never expected to. Simply having Sam's POV was not what made me start caring for him it was seeing him through Nina's eyes. Nina saw something in him worth paying attention to. "How he let her work and let her lead and let her show him things even while he ogled and bragged and postured. The contrast between what he performed for her and what he meant told her something that made her think about more than Sam's shoulders. Something made her wonder about why a man would try to distract her from noticing the best parts of himself. Maybe he hadn't noticed the best parts of himself." (Kindle Loc 226) Nina Paz is the daughter of Mexican migrant workers and a transplant from Washington State. She is a vibrant hard-working entrepreneur who with the help of her friends Tay and Rachel run a successful farm cafe and catering business. Nina has made a place for herself in Lakefield Ohio after the death of Russ her husband and childhood sweetheart in Afghanistan. In Sam Nina recognizes same sense of loss underneath his bluster and posturing as she feels in her own heart. "He lowered his eyes from hers shy suddenly of her seeing either his crass and tender thoughts." (Kindle Location 183) Nina and Sam have incredibly chemistry they can't keep their eyes hands or thoughts off each other. They sizzle: "She lifted her hand from the knob of the gearshift and trailed it over his thigh and it was a relief to touch him after talking to him all morning after watching him after watching him watch her. She pushed under the hem of his shorts to dig her fingers in the hard muscle above his knee. He inhaled fast and deep against her ear. "Harder."" (Kindle Loc 287) But they both know that physical connection is not enough. Nina has taken many casual lovers since the death of her husband to escape her feelings in feeling but she doesn't want to use Sam this way. Sam is not a moderate man he doesn't do casual all passion impulsivity and need. It takes real effort for them to work past each others emotional defenses and baggage to trust each other. Ms. Rivers' puts Nina and Sam through the wringer. Their relationship has multiple-false starts faux-pas and interruptions some light-hearted (their disastrous first date) and other heart-wrenching (Tay's cancer diagnosis). Sam and Nina have both been formed in distinct ways by grief and loss and their is a story how two people can build intimacy and trust after years of taking short-cuts or avoiding it all together. "It was rare to find friends anymore. Not because she wasn't surrounded by people but because if she wanted to be close to someone new she would need to share her life tell her stories reveal her healing grief." (Kindle Loc 253) In Live Destiny and Hefin need to find the thread of their own lives again to do things for themselves before they can reach for each other. In Laugh Sam and Nina both need to tend to emotional bruises they have ignored and find their way back to the family and loved ones they have hurt disappointed and pushed away as they reach for each other. "She was here far from her original home because everything that came after losing Russ salted the fields they had planted." (Kindle Loc 745) I love how Ms. Rivers writes and I often find myself stopping to admire her beautifully written sentences. Every single one of her stores has been a joy to read but what really makes her novels work for me is the attention she gives to characterization and that she doesn't just develop the main characters and surround them with cardboard stand-ins. While I hope to eventually read PJ Lacey and Sarah's stories even secondary supporting characters like Mike DeeDee Tay and Adam feel as real as Nina and Sam. They all have substance and weight and are not simply plot devices. "He'd wanted to tell Mike more about her but he knew as much as he joked about matchmaking about couples about the happiness he found that he also had been the voice of caution way too many times before when Sam had fallen headlong into what he thought was love only to find out again that it was all just him his heart overspilling until he thought that was he felt was what the woman felt too when what he was was just the hope he had for his own heart. "(Kindle Loc 524) I am very appreciative of how Ms. Rivers described and developed Nina and Sam. Nina is undeniably a first-generation Mexican-American but it is not the only or even most important part of her identity. She is not white-washed or fetishized and I am happy to add her to my personal list of non-stereotypical Latina heroines. I also really loved how Sam's ADHD was portrayed. One of my daughter's has an ADD diagnosis and there were points in the book where Sam's anxieties reactions and actions felt incredibly familiar and I can only thank Ms.Rivers for taking such care in her writing. Ms. Rivers did not have any information on her website beyond the titles for the next two books in the series so I asked her on twitter whose story was whose. @anacoqui LOVE is next and PJ and Lacey's story. ALWAYS is last and Sarah's story. -- Mary Ann Rivers (@MaryAnn_Rivers) May 3 2014 I will be eagerly awaiting them.

703,1059682,littlerosepa,I mistakenly thought the author was dead and that this book was a mash-up of pieces he left behind. Not so! But it still had a disjointed feel to it. While the descriptions of this ghoulish family are very detailed and imaginative the plot doesn't make a lot of sense. I couldn't figure out whether some scenes were supposed to be back in time or part of a dream or the experience of a different character. Very confusing!,1,1969-11-25 00:44:07
704,18338465,sileas,What an amazing story! I thoroughly enjoyed this mafia romance; and the love that develops between Carmine and Haven is truly EPIC! We have two teenagers who are far totally different walks of life. Carmine is basically considered a "Mafia Prince" (even though his father is fighting for his son not to be involved in "the life"); and then we have Haven who was saved by Vincent (Carmine's father)from a life of slavery. Although to Haven it feels like she has moved from one Master's house to another. She trusts no one and I can't say I blame her. As time goes on though she gets to know the sons of Vincent..and I must say that I was impressed with both of them. Dominic is the oldest one but he has a heart of gold-he really does. I am amazed the lengths that he goes to make Haven feel comforted accepted and never less than himself. Carmine is a tougher guy to like at first. He disrespects the girls that he is "sleeping with" he has extreme anger issues...Oh let's face it..he has so many issues it is hard to keep up. Not many truly like him because he is just a plain a-hole that has no regard for anyone including himself and his own well being. Then along comes Haven and these two bring out the best in each other. Carmine does a total personality change and amazingly as he falls in love with Haven he is as loyal as they come. I fell in love with him; but also with Haven too. They belonged together and if I have ever doubted fate in my romance books this is the book that makes me a firm believer in it! There is so much that takes place in this story it has it all: dramabetrayalhumorlovegrief...you name it; it has it. I loved the journey that the author takes us on and it is one of those books that I became fully absorbed into the lives of the characters. The past few days I have been walking around in a daze as even when I closed the book; it was still playing in my mind! To me that is the definition of an Epic book and a brilliant author. Sempre goes on my keeper shelf for sure and I can even see that down the road I would be interested in rereading it again! I won't ever forget the lengths that Carmine goes through for the love of his life. He is so dedicated to Haven and just thinking about it melts me. Do I highly recommend this book...Absolutely I do! I am kicking myself that I waited to read it for so long! Just a top quality book that I will never forget. Sempre will go down as one of my all time best romance books! Thank you J.M. Darhower for delivering such a masterpiece!!,1,2015-05-02 09:35:04
705,15156124,lordlion20,In my notes I wrote down some thoughts before I started reading The Catalyst. Basically that I knew nothing of this story before I started reading but I have read this authors work before and loved it. So I had high hopes for this story. Plus the main male is a panther shifter. That is completely hot in and of itself right?!? First this story starts with Fiona an agoraphobic witch who can't go past her own yard. And she doesn't practice her craft so she isn't exactly a very good witch. She never leaves the house at all she works from home has food delivered and doesn't even tend the yard. But right away you get the feeling (and you'd be right) that she is very caring and sensitive. You want her to get over her phobias and realize how much there is out there for her... Like a panther shifter in particular... Ahem. Then one day she finds a wolf pup in her yard who seems lost and hungry so she brings him in for some food. Then... CRASH!!! Enter Z! Woohoo hot panther! Way to make an entrance!! Z literally crashes through her window. Then he sees that she is a good witch and not a bad witch and well now he's crashed through her window. Bad panther!! Z sees an opportunity here though; nice woman wolf pup... sounds like a great way of easing his responsibilities! What Z does to get Fiona to come back to his home is absolutely priceless and I loved it. And I am not telling you what it is. But it is fantastic. Zoe Winters definitely injects bits of humor here and there throughout this story and I loved it. So now Z and Fiona have a mission. Take care of the pup and find his family. And his family are crossovers from other books of hers so if you are a Zoe Winters fan you will enjoy seeing Cole Jane and Cain. Frankly after reading this book I HAVE to read more about Cain. Wooohooo gotta love a demon! Back to this story. It really was full of lots of action. And because of the whole addition of Cole Jane and Cain I felt like I was getting two stories in one. As for Jane and Cole's situation I am not entirely sure what happened in their book so I don't want to blow the secret on that. But suffice it to say what happens in The Catalyst really feels like it's the best possible outcome. And even without knowing their whole backstory I was so happy for what happened there.... Ok Liz vague much?? If you are a fan of shifter stories than you will really love this. You've got wolves and panthers but on top of that this story also has demons and vampires. Really its terrific. The sexual tension and chemistry between Z and Fiona is palpable. You are on pins and needles waiting for "the moment". You know the moment the one where fireworks go off and you as the reader feel like you get everything you ever wanted because these two people who you have grown attached to finally get their acts together and "get together" themselves? Yeah that moment. And this story is chock full of wonderful moments that will have you cheering in excitement. And Fiona grows quite a bit within these pages and that was a real treat. Even though Alphas can definitely play the part of a jerk Fiona handles Z well and well... Z is an alpha panther shifter. Nuff said. Oh! Bonus! Cole (werewolf shifter) runs a website that all kinds of paranormal and not-so-paranormal beings use to get blood! And even better its an actual website so be sure to check out theriantype.com!,4,1999-04-08 16:42:27

Unfortunately I thought it disappointed in elements of its execution particularly the inclusion of Irene Adler in a way that just didn't seem to fit with the Conan Doyle material.

714,18071375,avrtrans,I was given a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review. Brief Overview Ana Sinclair is in love with her mom's new boyfriend. He's 10 years her senior with a teenage son but that doesn't sway her feelings. Not only does she live in the same house as Jake but also works with him. It's getting harder and harder to stay away from him. Things get interesting once they find out Ana's mom has left without any sign of ever coming back. Jake struggles to keep his distance from Ana although he desperately wants to possess every inch of her. He becomes her "knight in shining armour" when he gains knowledge that a serial killer is obsessed with Ana and has murdered girls who look just like her. I'm not gonna lie I had high hopes for this book after I read the synopsis. Seems like a decent plot right? Yeah I thought so too... However I soon discovered that the synopsis was as good as it was going to get. So many things irritated me about this book I had to skim over quite a bit just to get through it. Here's why. 1) I don't usually base my reviews on grammatical errors/editting unless they're really really bad. I honestly think this was the least editted book I've ever read for a few reasons: -Okay so I know the author is from England and the main character Ana was as well but all of the other character's dialogue was written as if they were also British... despite the fact that it takes place in the United States. -Grammatical errors GALORE! *soooooo many run on sentences * misspelled words *over used words (get a free thesaurus app) *quotes that start but don't end... I had to re read and try to guess when the person stopped talking. *punctuation. There were "?" when it wasn't even a question. Or some sentences didn't even have any punctuation at all. Others had too many commas. Ugh I hate that. -There was a scene at the bars where Ana always with her friend Jessie and she was talking to John Jackson and Trevor. But then during the conversation Ana refers to one of them as Tom. Tom is a whole other character that wasn't even there! Did she even read this before publishing?! That's my question for the author. -WHO says "whilst" a million times in one sentence?! I lost count of how many time it said "whilst" in this book it drove me nuts! In my opinion even if your a self published author you still have the responsibility to edit before submitting. I know editors are expensive and not everyone can afford them but there are alternatives. GOODREADS is full of beta readers willing to help! For free! You can also pass it along to friends and family and ask them for their opinions and see if they can catch any mistakes. A mistake here or there doesn't bother me. It's the careless mistakes that saturate the pages that bother me. 2) Story wise this was pretty lacking. I found it extremely predictable and I pretty much knew who the killer was immediately. I'm usually all for the steamy scenes but at one point it was page after page after page of the same thing. I've never skipped over sex scenes until this book. They were pretty anticlimactic as well. He's a cave man I get it no need to remind me every 5 seconds.. 3) The ending... random. I felt like it just stopped as if she wrote one long story and took a knife to it saying "oh this looks about halfway" CHOP- here's two books. If you're going to have a "cliffhanger" ending with plans for a second book make it good. I'm not going to remember your book a week from now if you don't have me on the edge of my seat. I won't be reading the next one of this series that's for sure. 4) I don't feel as though the characters were built properly. I didn't connect with any of them I didn't feel any emotions other than irritation "whilst" I read. (See what I did there) I could probably go on but those were the main issues I had. I really don't like giving bad reviews I don't like hurting people's feelings. But in this case there was no way I could possibly avoid it. Sometimes honesty is brutal.,4,1970-09-07 03:25:50

717,11827783,onelonewolf,Interesting take on the relationship between Holmes and Watson. Bugged me a bit when Holmes said "Elementary my dear inspector" as he never said that sort of thing in the books but that's me being nit-picky. Sherlockians might be a little bothered by this as a few liberties are taken but other than that it's pretty true to Conan Doyle's Sherlock. The allusion to A Study in Scarlet at the end was a nice touch. SENSITIVITY WARNING: death violence gore mutilated dead bodies,2,2010-11-26 21:37:34

Frustrate them with bureaucratic cover ups missing bodies a good dose of distrust and conspiracy. Shake well. And what have you got? A crackling good thriller in an uncommon setting with plenty of suspense action and romance. Walker has written and published more than 40 books in a variety of genre so he naturally has learned something about getting a reader's attention. I would suggest though the glitches in the transition to Kindle could stand some attention. The typos didn't keep me from reading but I'm sure they do distract some who might otherwise enjoy the story.,5,1983-03-19 00:44:39
719,9486270,rex5067,I'm pacing myself on these books because the first one was just so very good. And this one was just as good. Summary: A couple of months after the events in book one Kate is still scraping by. She's finding a balance between life as a mercenary with working for the Order both organizations being the cleanup squads for supernatural events but one private and the other official with all the red tape and organization that goes along with it. And that fragile balance is thrown off entirely by an approaching huge magic flare and Kate's inadvertently saddling herself with an adolescent waif who seems to be a target for some really bad-ass demonic creatures and whoever is controlling them. And of course this lands her smack back in the lap of the Pack. My take: Reviewing a book I love is so much harder than one I don't. When something sets my teeth on edge it's usually easy to spot and certainly no book is perfect and there are a couple of moments like that in this one. For instance despite the admonition that the magic flare makes keeping control difficult for the weres Curran takes being a glorious bastard to entirely new heights when he tells Kate she not only will sleep with him but she'll say please before and thank you after. The only saving grace to that little scene is that Kate makes a snappy exit and by the end of the book although she and Curran are on decent terms she's still not his little purring kitty cat doing as she's told. Which is in fact one really great thing about this series. It's got that early Moonlighting vibe the tension is so thick you could cut it with Kate's sword but she's just got too much going on. Even if it's been two years since she got some. Another odd thing about this is the hints that Max Crest Kate's erstwhile love interest from the first book would turn out to be someone sinister. I was half expecting him to be the big bad of this tale. That was either the reddest red herring ever or there is something coming up later. And I do expect it will come up because practically everyone still alive at the end of Magic Bites returns here or at least gets a mention. The continuity is great nothing is forgotten if it's been mentioned. There are some intriguing hints to the untold story of Kate's childhood too. She certainly has had something to do with the witches before she has vague memories she can't place and a helpful voice (a memory or something else?) that acts as a conscience at a crucial moment. And the witches recognized her not just by reputation either. The actual plot involves some rather muddled mythology possibly because Kate misunderstands it (as she points out nobody can keep all the deities and demons straight as long as you get the big picture and know where to look up the details.) It also occurs to me that if deities run on their worshipers faith like gas and since the ones who conjured up this particular nightmare were a bit confused perhaps the deity that resulted was a bit of a pastiche too. But more likely because the author did (other reviewers with more expertise in that area have covered that much more thoroughly than I can all I know of irish mythology is Cu Chulainn and that story of the wolfhound that saves the baby and is killed by mistake. Neither of whom make an appearance here. Maybe if Kate ever runs up against norse or Southern polynesian deities I'll be able to critique the mythology a bit more. But it's a fine line to tread bringing something "real world" into a fictional world. So that's about all the bad or at least wobbly bits and really they are quite minor. The new characters are a hoot Julie the waif may be just what Kate needs - her own childhood was less than peachy so maybe this is a way for her to experience it again but better. Albeit not perfect since Julie is an orphan who grew up below the poverty line and isn't exactly sunshine and unicorns herself. It's still a lot more normal than Kate ever had though! The relationship between Kate and Curran can probably only end one way again like Moonlighting but I like that it's not a big rush. And that they make each other completely crazy and not only in good ways. The frustration they spark in each other makes for some of the best dialogue in a book entirely full of awesome dialogue. Which is another thing worth mentioning: Kate is absolutely queen of snark and witty banter but usually not so stupid as to let them actually fall out of her mouth in the moments they'll only get her into more trouble. Would that more fantasy heroines had her restraint! Instead we often have her running mental commentary of things she'd like to say but doesn't and she's a blast. Anyway I'm just kind of rambling and I don't think I have a point. Just go find this series and read the first book and see if you don't fall in love with Kate as much as I have.,3,1977-08-26 13:46:44
720,12383580,sept77,No comment - I wrote it! However I should just say that the incorrect capital "I" in the title as shown is *not* down to me. When I uploaded the book's details it was all correct.

721,1059682,katenamuse,"The rememberers of noons." I like that. It's Ray Bradbury and his wonderful phrases and words that keeps the reader interested in this book. This is pure October (albeit I chose summer to read it) with wraiths and ghosts and vampires and werewolves and mummies all combining into one big somewhat happy family. What ambience is there? Are we kin to autumn rains? As the cover of the book illustrates (by the great Charles Addams) the centre of this book is a house a huge house in midwest America. It is the home of a strange family which is experiencing a reunion with members from around the world. These are not humans so it doesn't matter if there aren't enough beds because cellar coffins and empty chimneys will do just fine. There must be a mouse in every warren a cricket on every hearth smoke in the multitudinous chimneys and creatures almost human icing every bed. Somehow the parents managed to adopt a human child Timothy who wants very much to be a part of this strange family. The boy is much treasured by his aunts and uncles and cousins and especially by his ancient grandmere she who was born into death two thousand years before Jesus and the crown of thorns. It is Timothy who helps to save the family when echoing whiffs of angry villagers with torches start their march. Are we shadows on a ruined wall? Are we dusts shaken in sneezes from angel tombstones with broken wings? It took me a bit to get into this perhaps because this wasn't written as one novel but as a series of magazine stories throughout Bradbury's life all woven together for publication in 2000. Timothy the boy is not strong enough to keep the level of interest high but it all comes together toward the end. I am one of those folks who respect cemeteries in the belief that someone must visit the forgotten. That's what this book reminds me of the wisp of remembrance we all have before our own time comes. Bradbury even captures the spirits who lurk behind squeaky doors. While oils glistened the gates and doors of the world there was always one door one hinge where I lodged for a night a year or a mortal lifetime. Put not butter nor grease nor bacon-rind upon my resting places. Pure Bradbury. Since he was "raised by libraries" I have engaged upon visiting the local libraries more often in memory of he who could write.

The 13 Clocks of this tale sit frozen "slain" by the villainous Duke. "I slew time in these gloomy halls" The wicked Duke sets up impossible tasks for the young men who come to ask for the hand of Princess Saralinda with the result of such men being fed to the Duke's geese. Will the handsome minstrel be next? Is he really a minstrel? And who is the invisible Listen? Listen can be heard but never seen. This is a tale to be read to the youngsters although adults may also enjoy it. I liked the tale although I felt a Madison Avenue-type outlook from the beginning a little too New Yorkish and cynical for my tastes. But the New York Review Children's Collection has made this a tough book to walk past with the holiday red binding and front cover artwork.

He can't ignore his need to see her again even knowing she must be a hated Macrory. Gilda Macrory trespasses Macraig land but haunting memories of the young man she once met there draw her to the forbidden place. Learning he is Laird Macraig's son threatens her dreams for her father would never agree to a marriage between his daughter and their enemy's son. With pirates raiding the coast bad blood between the Macraig and Macrory clans could cost Ryan and Gilda their love--and their lives. ~~~ REVIEW: 3.75 stars--THE HIGHLANDER'S TEMPESTUOUS BRIDE is the third installment in Cathy MacRae's The Highlander's Bride historical romance series. Advancing the series approximately twelve years THE HIGHLANDER'S TEMPESTUOUS BRIDE focuses on Ryan Macraig and Gilda Macrory. Gilda is the daughter of Laird and Lady Macrory whom we met in book two-The Highlander's Reluctant Bride. The storyline focuses on the simmering feud between the Macraig and Macrory Clans. When Laird Ranald Macrory calls a meeting of the local Lairds to deal with the recent threats by pirates and thieves it does not go unnoticed the attraction between his daughter and that of his enemy's son. What ensues is a hastily arranged personal and private declaration between two young lovers whose actions put into motion the growing animosity between father and son and the neighboring clans. An attack by pirates against the Lairds and their villagers finds Gilda caught between two families and yearning for the love of a man she had only known for a very short time. The relationship between Gilda and Ryan is quick to develop. While each has been betrothed to another Gilda and Ryan ensure that their future belongs to one another. The sex scenes are passionate but mostly implied. The secondary and supporting characters include Gilda's parents Ranald and Catriona her younger siblings as well as Ryan's family and best friend Conn. Ryan's father wants nothing to do with his son's choice for a wife but circumstances will change when the families go to war against marauding pirates and thieves. Cathy MacRae continues to build upon the Highlands of Scotland the stormy seas of an unforgiving ocean and the backdrop of Scottish castles and thriving villages. Her continued use of Scottish brogue and text brings the foothills of Scotland onto the pages of The Highlander's Bride Series. My only complaint is the quick resolution and reveal as it pertains to a major plot point in the story. The building animosity and mistaken beliefs were quickly remedied within a short period of time. There are moments of heartbreak and presumed betrayal that barely merited a mention but ones that could have aroused painful and intense feelings of anger and hurt. THE HIGHLANDER'S TEMPESTUOUS BRIDE is a compelling and seductive addition to Cathy MacRae's The Highlander's Bride historical romance series. The breathtaking and stunning grounds of the historical Scottish Highlands stirs the imagination and startling wonder of times long ago.

724,16130164,martcopy,3.75 stars BLOOD WARRIOR is the second full length novel in Lindsey Piper's Dragon King series focusing on the descendants of a powerful species of supernatural warriors. This series is not about dragon shifters but about a race who believe they have connections to the dragon and all of its' powers. Blood Warrior focuses on Tallis Pendray - member of the Pendray Dragon Kings and a berserker. His violent history among the Dragon King clans is well known but the cause of his rage and pain is not. His search for the woman who has invaded his dreams for twenty years has ended and with it so too will he end her life. Only the woman he has found is not the woman from his dreams-something about Kavya of the Indranan Clan screams 'mine' where the woman from his dreams pushed him beyond sanity and into the depths of a two decades murderous rage and revenge. Kavya is a beautiful Dragon King-one of three triplets- and on the run from the brother who means to take her life as he took their sister's years before. Gathering the telepathic Indranana and other Dragon King Clans together for peace and solidarity Kavya will come face to face with her worse nightmares-Tallis of the Pendray Clan and her brother. Hoping for the lesser of two evils Kayvy runs with Tallis only to discover the man has come to take her life. The storyline follows Kavya and Tallis as they try to outrun Kavya's brother and their growing attraction to one another. The relationship begins as a captor and jailer to friends and lovers but the road is fraught with bloodshed anxiety memories of betrayal and lust and a constant need to run from a brother she once loved and called her friend. The sexual attraction between the two is immediate although both try to deny their feelings. Once again the world building and storytelling is detailed graphic and fast paced. A little more is revealed about the Dragon King Clans and their history but on a need to know basis throughout each storyline and novel. The series reads like a dystopian/paranormal storyline as the five major Dragon King clans fight for survival in a contemporary human world that at time rivals many historical romance settings. Lindsey Piper takes the reader on a tour of Europe and Asia and into the mountains of the Himalayas all the while weaving a story of betrayal and survival among the five Dragon King Clans. www.thereadingcafe.com,3,1991-06-11 04:02:54
725,6676287,holita,I really didn't like this book which was an extra disappointment as I'd been intrigued going in as it was not only fantasy but also billed as one that had caused a big splash when it was first published. The fact that it came out quite a while ago should have been my first clue though as this book is seriously dated. Not in the sense of how people act or what they say as it is set in a distinctive time period and everything (seems) authentic in that sense. No it was more in the writing style that it is really dated. That now cliched saying of 'show don't tell'? This book has never even heard of it. All it does is tell. Over and over again in boring and extraneous detail. This slows the pace of what little plot there is to the point of tedium. I distinctly remember reaching the 100 page mark and realizing just how little had actually happened. I kept waiting for the story to take off. It never did. All that the main character does is wait around for things to happen to him and then semi react when they do. And then there is the female character. No name is needed as she is practically the only one but even she isn't real. No instead she is quite literally the fantasy product of one of the male characters (whether it is the father the brother or the main character isn't ever quite made clear). There are some vague references made to her being strong and knowing how to handle herself and yet she still ends up being the damsel in distress that needs to be rescued. Plus she's sexualized despite the reader being repeatedly told that she's not even quite an adult. Add to this the fact that apparently we have some unconscious genetic memory of all the myths/folklore of the past in our heads and yeah I was not at all impressed. Especially not since there were the nuggets of an interesting idea buried in all of it. Would not recommend to anyone at all.,5,1985-11-20 03:49:12

Do not pass it by. Five Stars for the story. But... One Star for the formatting and the problems with punctuation. But don't let this stop you.

727,27036538,ogdenp,Very strong continuation of Alan Moore's take on the "crossed" who are basically humans infected with a virus that completely lowers all their inhibitions not unlike the rage virus from the 28 Days and 28 Weeks Later movies. It's a hundred years since the virus first manifested and life should finally be getting back to normal for the survivors. Lacking all impulse control the crossed have largely died out except for the odd cell here and there. But in Moore's initial volume a team of survivors out digging for history and remnants of the old society came across hints that maybe just maybe there's a hidden society of super-crossed who have managed to keep some of their worst impulses in check (murder cannibalism incest) just enough to survive and prosper. Here it's pretty much all-out war as it becomes apparent that an army of the crossed has been making "deals" with a number of isolated settlements: hand over 10 people a year and the rest can stay alive. The survivors of a number of settlements that refused to give in have descended upon Murfreesboro and things are about to get even more serious. This comic is a challenge to read because of the future speak that Moore came up with and that Spurrier refines but after awhile you kind of get the hang of it and it isn't all that hard to follow what's going on. Spurrier's Crossed: Wish You Were Here was one of the strongest storylines in this entire universe and what he does here in volume 2 has me very optimistic to see what will come in volume 3. Scary depressing yet ultimately hopeful post-apocalyptic storytelling.,1,2002-12-26 12:27:13

730,13505910,jshojvg,If you are a fan of the Twilight Series by Stephanie Meyer or a fan of Buffy etc. you will devour this book (no pun intended). Kate's style is quirky funny and cute. But don't let that deceive you because there is enough violence and blood to keep you interested. Combine that with a war between vampires reincarnation and two soul mates searching for their past and future and you have a pretty nifty little vampire novel here which (I feel) is perfect for young adults. This kind of book is not normally my cup of tea (I normally prefer a grittier read) but it says a lot that the author kept me more than interested enough to finish in a decent amount of time. And like I said young adults will love this book. The only issues I had were that I thought the "scope" of the book seemed a bit too confining in some ways. Also I took issue with the amount of time it took for the primary character to be "trained up" or acclimated to her new situation; I also questioned some of the motivation of the main character at the getgo. I could explain all this in more detail but I don't want to give anything away. Other than that Kate writes to her strengths and presents a pretty dominating read. Well worth the purchase.,4,1971-07-16 18:20:13
731,18338465,terlen64,I've been sitting here most of the day wondering what to writing for this review. My head is still lost in it. There is so much happening in Sempre yet it all flows perfectly from start to finish. There was nothing I didn't like about it. Sempre follows the growing relationship between Haven and Carmine while dealing with the pressures that life is throwing at them. Nothing is ever easy for them and being in the middle of the Mafia war doesn't make it any easier either. Haven is one strong female lead. How she managers to deal with everything that has happened to her is beyond me. Most people would have given up. But Haven believes that there is still hope out there and the future could be better. No has to be better than the hand she was dealt with at birth. On the other hand Carmine has the world at his feet yet chooses to throw it all away for nothing. He just seems to be floating through life from day to day. Enjoying the good things but never really taking anything for granted. Carmine doesn't start to live until he has something to fight for something worth losing. Haven is his heaven. Together they make each other more than just an empty shell. However not everyone is happy with their relationship and soon the danger begins. Everyone wants something from Haven and Carmine. Can they survive it all and still love each other just as deeply. Read more to read out. It must be noted that this is not a book for everyone. There are some dark and disturbing themes involved in the story. However I feel that the story might fall a little flat without them.,1,2006-09-07 16:17:01
732,18338465,johnfischer2,This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland Sempre was a strangely good read for me. I read it over about a week which is not how I normally read books. I usually finish a book in a day two tops. I had a friend visiting so I only had an hour or so to read every day so I had to just keep picking it back up and re-immersing myself into the story. That is where the strangely good came in. I was loving the story loving getting to know both Carmine and Haven loving everything but every time I picked the book back up and started reading I would think "wait a minute. Why am I loving this so much? The writing is just so so and not really my thing..." but I would continue reading and quickly was back in the story and had forgot about the writing. Odd. I don't think I would have even noticed anything had I read it straight through like I normally do. So even though I kept thinking the writing is only so so when starting to read by a couple paragraphs in I was back in the story and back to loving it. I can't wait to read the next book now and see the next chapter of their lives! Sempre is the story of Haven and Carmine. Haven has not had a good life when this story opens. Really she has one of the worst situations I have read for a book character. Her father is incredibly abusive somehow related to a mob family her mother is abused as well so she can't help she fears for her life daily and is basically a slave. For as long as she can remember she has been told that is what she is and she is not like everyone else. She is not good enough to be out in the world. She is not supposed to know how to read or write she didn't really have any education except about house chores she has a miserable existence. And yet she is such a kind sole. Haven is this amazing person and it is not until Carmine's father saves her that she can really let herself become who she is. It doesn't happen overnight and it is not easy to undo all the harm she suffered growing up but she is starting to find a place that she can feel safe. True she doesn't completely trust Carmine's father especially after a few bad incidents but it is much better than where she was. At the beginning she still can't go outside she is trapped in the house but at least no one is beating her or threatening her life daily. If she makes a mistake here she is not punished. Oh I loved reading her story. I loved seeing her come out of her shell and be who she really is. She was great. Carmine hasn't really been good since his mom died. He was there when it happened and he hold so much guilt and anger in that he is not in a good way. He sleeps around has never had a girlfriend just drinks and does drugs and generally messes up on a daily basis. He can't keep his anger in check but getting to know Haven changes him. She makes him want to be a better person. She makes him want to be good enough for her. I loved him. He was hurting so much but he is this amazing person who is there for Haven whenever she needs him. He is a fighter and he will definitely fight for her. It was like when they were thrown together there wasn't any other option. They were it for each other. Not that it is easy. It takes them a while to even be comfortable in the same room together. Haven especially is skittish since she is just a slave. She is not good enough for someone like Carmine. She never will be...and Carmine is terrified of letting someone else get close. Everything he has ever loved has been taken from him and he doesn't want it to happen again. Oh it was heartbreaking at times but these two are so sweet together. The story is a longer one not that I am complaining. You get to see a lot of Carmine and Haven. You get to see them fall in love and deal with some of the complications that entails. See them deal with some new information see them try and work with the mob family aspect see them just create this very solid foundation. Through all the ups and downs they are there for each other. While this book doesn't end on a cliffhanger it does end on a bit of an open ending so I am eager to read the next chapter of their story.,2,1975-06-21 20:58:17
733,16110527,stormalong,With Never J. Grace Pennington has done something that I've always felt had fascinating possibilities--setting a traditional murder mystery in the Old West. But there is also another layer to the story that takes it beyond a simple whodunit. On the one hand is the traditional set-up of the small circle of suspects the puzzling bits of evidence and the amateur detectives' efforts to fit it all together but then there is the additional plotline of Travis' sentence in the coal mines and something darker at work there that just might tie into the reason for the murder. On the mystery side I thought the sleepwalking angle that sets the stage for the night of the crime was a particularly clever idea. The legal situation in the town seems decidedly unusual but I suppose that is part of the point of the story after all. I personally was more interested in the mystery angle than the mine scenes where the emphasis on the filth and sordidness of the workers' living conditions can sometimes get a little hard to take. But in spite of that I definitely felt that it's the central theme of the book expressed in that one word Never--never compromise--that ties the whole book together and is its most compelling element possibly even stronger than the mystery plot. Some of the best passages in the story are the ones dealing with this theme. It's nice to find a book that simply and straightforwardly roots characters' determination to do right in their Christian faith without making it seem tacked on just to make the book "Christian." Readers who appreciate that may enjoy this story even if they've never considered trying a Western or a mystery before.,1,1996-01-21 00:39:00
734,7353587,bondik1994,I first heard the author interviewed on one of my favorite podcasts For Crying Out Loud. I liked her sensibility and advice. This book doesn't have much that is new or innovative but it had good reminders especially about communication and respect.,1,1979-09-28 19:22:15
735,22241198,lcerchie,Ariel's Dangerous Liaisons \ The Erotic Adventures of a Super Heroic Woman Liz Adams 4 of 5 Stars When the book ended it made a four. It was a cheerful and happy ending that I wished had been more of the book. It is a Russian book of sorts staring Lenya the Russian winter in a bit part along with vodka Bratva gangsters rock-metal music scenes and walkup Russian apartment houses. It would have been better with more Tolstoy: "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way" or even a little Gogol Taras Bulba. The writing was clear and the story moved along well but without those dark twists and tangles from the land of the snow and the bear. There was much sex in the book that sometimes got in the way of the action of the story. It is erotica after all and that was expected but there was a story that wanted to be told also. That story wrapped up at the end neatly with a humorous and light-hearted note that brought everything around at last. It is an easy book to read for a beach when you want to put down War And Peace and watch the frolicking around you in a sexy summer romance kind of way. It seemed that the author had fun writing the ending more of that please.,5,2018-07-11 18:38:18
736,18488643,aheiro's,*I received an ARC from the author in exchange for an honest review* Jade is a Seductor part of a secret organisation who often have to use their powers of seduction in order to complete their mission. She is one of the best and halfway through her 10 year contract when she gets given the big job Oliver Kirkham. The young handsome CEO of a weapons company Jade has been hired to steal some information from a hard drive which will be very close to his heart a relatively straight forward if not time consuming job or so she thought. Being one of the best Jade has always been able to keep her emotions out of her job but she doesn't factor in the emotions Oliver elicits in her. She absolutely can not fall in love with him or it will end very badly for both of them. I was attracted to the general plot line of this story it seems so plausible that there could be a Seductor type organisation out there somewhere. As much is explained about this in the the story there is always the elusive air of mystery about a lot of the details behind the organisaation which I found intrigued me. Jade is a brilliant character great to see such an internal struggle going on whilst on this mission and it was interesting to see how she dealt with different situations. I am desperate to read the next one in the series just to find out what happens as there is a HUGE cliff hanger ending. I will be waiting on tenterhooks for more a well deserved 5* read.,4,2011-11-03 16:12:53

739,18338465,bleevinue," 'We should head inside before we get caught. You can bring the bugs with you.' Shaking her head she unscrewed the lid. 'They should be free' she said quietly watching as the fireflies flew away. " Haven and Carmine Dancing with the Fireflies Starting this I knew I was in for a rollercoaster of emotions. This book will stick with me because of what it stands for and reading it I went through a series of heartaches angry bouts confusion moments of love and moments of grief. After hearing all the heartfelt reviews and praise that this book has got I finally made my own conclusion that this book was neither here nor there for me. This goes without saying but... I enjoyed reading Sempre. I hate that I couldn't give it all the stars that these characters deserve but there were some elements of this novel that didn't quite rub right with me. The Writing The writing in Sempre is lyrical - it captivated me right from the very beginning and if there is anything that made me fall hard for this story it was the way the author put it together using pathos in her words. I found that there were often times when I didn't grasp what was happening in a scene quite well until a couple chapters later it would be cleared out. The writing was a star in itself. The Romance Human Trafficking is the 3rd largest criminal industry in the world. There is no romance that surrounds the concept of human trafficking. However the story in itself surrounded the love that two people gained while fighting for freedom. Although it seemed very 'insta-love' and personally I like to fall for the love that the characters have just as they too are falling for each other. That doesn't seem to work for me when it happens in an instant. Throughout the first quarter of chapters surrounding Haven and Carmine falling for each other it felt like one chapter she was running away from him and the next she was completely enamored by him. It felt rushed and the author had 51 chapters. Carmine DeMarco This was the big one for me. Carmine DeMarco is such a multi-dimensional character and I truly felt the author trying to portray that through the pages of Sempre. However I couldn't get through to him as a character. I felt all the while I was understanding Haven a bit more I was losing Carmine's character. He felt very stoic and I didn't see the character development that I saw with the other characters. His temper was an issue with me it wasn't that he had a temper - it was the way it affected the story. Scenes that really disturbed me was whenever Nicholas was mentioned with Haven. The way that Carmine acted after is.not.okay. Fighting was always the result without hearing the story and this could have changed and he could have developed as a character. However even during the end - we see Carmine acting out (in a very severe manner) because Nicholas is talking to Haven. The Plot and the Ending I enjoyed the atmosphere that the plot gave out the tone the author uses encompasses the mystery dread and all the fucked-upness of the plot. It wasn't all about the romance it had many side stories within it that allowed the reader to want to know more. If I could explain the feels I went through while reading the ending it would go somewhat like this... I didn't know what to make of it it was breath-taking and heart wrenching and I am so glad that I read through the whole book just so I could experience the end chapters.

740,32732823,icyhacker,As I don't really read YA I did not know what to expect from this I really liked the plot line it reminded me of a tv series (Young American's) I used to love growing up so I decided to give it a go. I was not disappointed. I really loved it!! It had action suspense and sweet affectionate love and some hot and heavy make outs. I loved the characters they were really interesting and original. Christiana is strong and reluctant and does so well in her position. I loved her fight. Trey is super hot and incredibly protective shaping up to be a nice alpha character. I was a little disappointed at the end as I needed more and I felt the story was unresolved for my liking However I was extremely pleased to see that this is part of a trilogy and fingers crossed we get more. The authors writing style and story telling is wonderful I felt fully entertained and enjoyed every minute. All up I read this in one day it was so good I couldn't put it down. I am so looking forward to the next two parts I cannot wait.,3,1964-02-07 10:45:55
741,29910658,DOGGOT,Eunis is an albino with mermaid tendencies. She grew up without a father with a mother who despises her and siblings who fear her. Because of her condition Eunis is obsessed with the idea of beauty and spends her life exploring the science behind the genetics of beauty and our interpretation of facial features. Eunis should be a likable character. She should but she's not. Maybe it's because of the writing but I just could not connect to Eunis or get into the book. After a hundred pages I gave up. This book I feel is suffering from an identity crisis. Like Eunis it doesn't know what it truly is. There are aspects of magical realism issues with mental health and probably more things I'll never get to. The author should've either given the reader more time with the main character in the beginning or dropped in on Eunis as an adult. Things happen too quickly in this novel so quickly that we do not have time to feel touched by the important moments. This book had so much potential. I'm sad that it didn't live up to my expectations. I received a free electronic copy of this book from LibraryThing.,2,1988-08-11 05:29:03
742,22760798,balajee,Disclaimer: I haven't read the House of Night series. I've never been inclined to pick it up but I was sent this novella for review and I thought it would be the perfect way for me to see if this world and its characters are something I'd be interested reading about. I want to make this clear: I went into this novella wanting to love it. P.C Cast and Kristin Cast have been writing full length novels since 2007 (I did a Goodreads search) so there is really no excuse for how poorly written this novella is. The dialogue is artificial the storytelling confused and the novella comes across as laboured. I gather that Kalona's some kind of dream hunk in the main series? Maybe he's a potential love interest for someone? Anyway from the moment he is conceived Kalona is irrationally jealous and possessive of Nyx. There was nothing in this character that made me like him - he had no reason to be jealous especially since Nyx had only ever been with him. Erebus on the other hand was always sweet and understanding and although I get that Nyx wasn't sexually attracted to him I still thought she would be much happier with him than with Kalona. Not that Nyx was much more likeable than her chosen lover: vain naive to the point of stupidity and blind to the feelings of others she probably made a better match for Kalona than Erebus. But it wasn't the characters that had me screaming in frustration when I was reading this - it was the poor story-telling. The authors were going for a grand mythic kind of storytelling similar to Greek epics. They were unable to deliver in my opinion and the result is a story that includes awkward dialogue and needless repetition of certain phrases (there were only so many times I could read 'Warrior and lover playmate and friend' or variations of it). Lengthly descriptions of every form that the goddess Nyx could take were tiring and the relationship between Nyx and Mother earth can generously be described as irksome. The actual story of why Kalona was kicked out of the Otherworld is interesting but completely and utterly predictable. I liked the idea of the three tests and how they brought out different aspects of the brother's personalities. The world-building was lush and the descriptions of the Otherworld and a much younger Earth were wonderful. My favourite part about the book (indeed the only reason I kept reading it after the first few chapters) are the illustrations. They are absolutely gorgeous! This paperback edition has 11 black and white illustrations placed at the beginning of each chapter showing a scene from that chapter. They are wonderful and I think that it's worth getting the novella in print just for the illustrations. Having starting the novella with the intent of scoping out the main series I have to say I am disappointed in the quality of the writing and will not be pursuing the House of Night novels. However fans of the series who probably like this writing style will enjoy the chance of getting to know all about Kalona's creation and his time in the Otherworld.

743,16130164,golantarm,Originally published at Reading Reality The worldbuilding of the Dragon Kings finally un-murks. On the other hand the sheer dark gritty gloom and doominess of Silent Warrior and Caged Warrior definitely dials down a couple of notches. As to which you prefer the mileage certainly varies. We've met the hero Tallis of Pendray in Caged Warrior. We discover that he not only wrapped up the action in that cage-match he kicked it off by leading the Asters to Audrey's house at the start of it all. (See my review for more details.) Tallis was misled. He believed that the Asters only wanted to question Audrey. Why he let himself believe a criminal "family" would stop at civilized questions is beyond this reader. But the reason he allowed himself to be misled at all that's a whole other issue. Tallis has been following the mental seduction of "The Sun" for 20 years. This female cult leader has promised him that she was leading their people towards reunification and peace by having him murder key leaders blocking her path. Oh and she promised him dream sex and a meeting with their totem Dragon god along the way. But the kidnapping and torture of Audrey broke the spell she had over him because she lied. Because the Asters murdered Audrey's husband in cold blood. And because Audrey was his niece. Tallis set out in search of the physical location of "The Sun" and the members of her cult and found Kavye -- an Indraman woman of the Dragon Kings the real true leader of the Sun cult and not the woman who had driven him to execute Dragon Kings in her name. Instead Kavye was the least powerful of an Indraman telepathic triplet hiding from the mad brother who had murdered their sister and sought her life in order to merge her power with his. That's the curse of the Indraman clan. Kavye's brother found her disciples while Tallis was still figuring out the best way to disgrace her. Pashkah's massacre of her followers ground any attempt at unification into the dust. Tallis and Kavye ran from the madman. The irony that the Dragon's gift to the Pendray is the berserker rage and that the two of them are running from a Dragon King who has gone completely insane is intended. The Indraman are telepaths and the only way that Tallis can fight off Kavye's people is to give in to the insane side of his own nature. Losing his rationality is his best protection. But Tallis still needs to think. If Kavye was not the woman who enthralled him who is that temptress? Whose nefarious purpose has he been serving for 20 years? Whoever she is she is not just his enemy but the enemy of all the remaining Dragon Kings. She is especially the enemy of the woman he first wanted to disgrace but now needs to protect at all costs even against the beast that is part of his own nature. Escape Rating B+: I liked Blood Warrior better than Caged Warrior because Kavye and Tallis start the story in positions of relative equality. They have different sets of powers but Kavye doesn't start out the story beaten down to nearly nothing the way that Audrey/Nynn does in Caged Warrior. I also liked Silent Warrior (see review) a lot for the same reasons. Kavye is a bit naive about a few of the facts of life and I don't mean because she starts the story as a virgin. I mean that she believes that unification will be a whole lot easier than it could possibly be under the circumstances. Us regular humans have more trouble than she thinks her people will have and we don't have some of the more interesting curses they do like the divided power of the Indraman twins and triplets. Also she's never explored the rest of the world outside her native India. Tallis has traveled the world unfortunately mostly on murder missions for her evil mental twin. But he's still led a much less sheltered life than she has. On the other hand she has a belief that things can get better for them as individuals and for their people. He doesn't believe in much of anything. She gives him redemption and he gives her not just the right but also the ability to be her authentic self and feel real feelings and have an actual real life. The other part that I enjoyed was that the backstory of the world of the Dragon Kings finally began to be revealed. Hallelujah! I needed this to get clearer for the overall story arc to make sense and it's getting there. We even met the Dragon.,4,1992-05-20 19:09:35

745,18338465,gulnur83kg,That's it! I've had enough! There's so much in here that rubs me the wrong way I'm surprised I've gone this far as it is. DNF @70% I'll start with the worst and move on upward It was waaaaaay too long and too slow!!! I mean this is like reading someone's diary: all the meals they're having bathroom breaks lectures at school overstuffed descriptions constant dialogues that don't contribute to the story - there's only so much your brain needs to get the image. Why overdo it? Quantity doesn't necessarily mean quality. If I were to edit this book it will shrink to the one third of it. The rest is absolutely useless in my opinion. Love at first sight is a guarantee for a boring romance not to mention a huge mistake in a book of 1500 epub pages. What does it leave a reader with? Exactly - nothing to look forward to. In my case it also means being unable to connect to the couple and believe in their romantic relationship. Carmine who is your typical rich and spoilt teenager behaving like a first-class asshole and a womaniser. Not only is he drinking alcohol more often than not and uses drugs but he also pushes an innocent girl whom he claims to like do the same! Oh and don't forget his violence towards anybody who will as much as look at the girl landing those guys in a hospital! What kind of chivalry is that? And as soon as the magical L-word is out (which was way sooner than realistically possible) the guy drops all his 'faults' and becomes a saint. Sorry but I don't buy this kind of romance. Absence of steam. None whatsoever. I can handle it better in a normal-sized book but to go for so long without any adrenaline is stressing me out. Mafia world. It's my personal opinion of course but when the mafia is the central force in the story I can't help but dislike it normally. There are exceptions but this was not one of them unfortunately. Lack of drama. And by this I mean the lack of anything significant. There was no hardship for two young people to become close no problems arguments or even misunderstandings in their relationship. The only captivating thing about the MCs and the whole book in general was the mysterious past of the girl and what was so important about her role that turned DeMarco's world upside down. This was the only reason I kept on reading. And as soon as my questions were answered more or less I've decided to give up... Finally I don't know if I'm getting older but I found myself much more fascinated with Carmine's father Vincent. I'd much rather see him recover from his loss try to redeem himself and stop this lonely existence. If I cared for anybody's happy ending here it would be his. But for some reason I don't see it happening so there goes my last hope.,3,2007-02-15 08:08:21

749,13571772,Gunsmoke32,A Captain America story involving a Russian assassin known as Winter Soldier. Trying hard here not to give away spoilers. In a lot of ways this story is a trip down memory lane for both Captain America and his fans with many references to his origin and his activities in the second world war. There are also appearances here of many of Cap's more recent associates ranging from Iron Man through to the Falcon and Sharon Carter of SHIELD. In the end I thought the character interaction overrode the plot somewhat. However that might be more an artifact of this collected work rather than a lacking in the storytelling. Winter Soldier's controller is still at large at the end of this book and has succeeded in at least part of his plans. So despite the loss of Winter Soldier and another resource which I will not reveal it would seem that the overarching story is not completed. I thought the artwork was very good but there were a few places where I thought they had Cap doing things with his shield throwing that just aren't physically possible no matter how good he might be. Recommended to long time Cap fans.,2,2010-12-28 09:52:18

Was it Quentin who has a drug habit? Annie Nathan whose father always in need of money for his 'big idea'? and what is it with Reggie and Ai Leen that Inspector Singh didn't like? Even Inspector's Singh relative Jagdesh seems to have something to hide. Or is it possible that the victim's second wife Maria Thompson murdered her husband for insurance money so that she could reunite with her two children in Phillipines? Why did first wife Sarah the ex-Mrs Thompson lied that she is with her friend Joan when she is not? Through these characters Flint is able to paint a desponding view about the society of Singapore. In the name of money and greed white collar crime and murder(s) are committed. I expect the third instalment to be lacklustre from the 2nd instead it was a pleasant surprise that I would stumbled upon so much red herrings that could fill a pond so many plot twists that derailed me in Singapore School of Villainy. I have lived and worked in Singapore for a year and for the next 5 years visited the island at least once a year. Shamini Flint did not introduce the island or provide a flavour of it as she did in Bali the story is more focus on the characters. The last scene of the perpetrator in preparation of the hanging was a chilling one. As the noose is laid over the head of the perpetrator let it be known that in Singapore (and many parts of Asia) one can be hung for drug trafficking and murder. I love Shamini Flint's writing. She writes with clarity and beautiful in description. I enjoyed reading both her books very much. I think she deserves to be read more widely and I will devour all books in the Inspector's Singh series. For full review see: http://bibliojunkie.wordpress.com/201...,5,1981-04-26 13:43:18

756,3397349,vikylka9696,Adorable. I really really liked this. It's like an odd cross between Wind in the Willows and Dr. Seuss. There are shallow characters kind characters vain characters selfless characters and characters with questionable morals all wrapped up in this funny little family who will accept anyone who seems to need a family. It sort of wanders about telling bits of tales that make up a lovely summer in the Valley of the Moomins. There's never any real sense of alarm even when the Groke shows up because everyone can be reasoned with or at the very least least bought. And where one person finds their limits another steps in to help. It's adorable. I love it.,4,1992-05-14 04:14:52
757,32606520,scrboy,Chastity (Canada) and Kanen (Wrecker) make a good couple. They meet when she moves to Texas from Canada after her baby and husband are killed in a car accident. He's the most famous bronc riding cowboy in the area and when he sees Chastity he knows he wants her. But they have some obstacles to get through if they want their happily ever after namely her broken heart and his hardened heart. There are other obstacles like the racism he (as part Native American) faces and how it ultimately affects his career and her short lived waitressing job. Chastity and Kanen have good chemistry and I really like the premise. It's a bit of insta love but it works well and the heat between the two is believable.

763,18338465,kota1987,I love this mafia story. It was long 500+ pages and thankfully I never had a bore moment. It was plot driven and center around this mysterious slave girl Haven. Haven is a slave girl brought into the DeMarco family by Carmine's dad Vincent. I enjoyed her growth from the scared little girl to someone more. But she was obviously powerless in the whole situation and the main catalyst for basically 'everything' that went wrong. Carmine was such a naive hotheaded little bugger. There were numerous time that I wanted to yell him to just 'grow the hell up'. I guess he was just acting what he was supposed to be the 17 years old self entitled mafia prince. His only saving grace is his love for Haven. Apart from that he needs to know the world doesn't revolves around him. Honestly I enjoyed Vincent's POV the most. He was such a tortured soul and never be able to catch a break with his youngest son. He tried so hard to separate his family from the business to no avail. Something is just destined to be. Lastly Uncle Corrado definitely needs to be mentioned. The so-called cold blooded killer he had this quiet presence that just so damn magnetic. I'm dying to read more about him in the next book. Overall the majority portion of the book felt pretty much YA to me. There were only glimpses into the mafia biz from Vincent POV and towards the end when all hell break loose. But with the ending we are having I'm sure the next book is gonna centered more on the Salvatore's and the gang.,2,2006-10-10 23:45:30

765,18777580,jets11,Laugh is the second book in the Burnside series. This story focuses on Sam Burnside the eldest of the Burnside siblings. We are introduced to Sam in book one Live where he comes across as a very unsympathetic character whose sole purpose seems to be making everyone around him miserable. In Laugh we get to know Sam. I've got to tell you I absolutely love him. He goes about things all wrong most of the time but his heart is in the right place. He just has a hard time expressing himself and tact is not in this man's vocabulary. So what happens to a man who has more love for his family than he knows what to do with and the only thing he can count on is messing up when he meets an attractive woman who's strong smart and most importantly understands him? How will he keep from messing this up too? Reading Mary Ann Rivers reminds me of a chess game. It's not so much he did this she said that. He said this. They did that and then this happened. It's more like he sat and pondered and remembered and he moved here. She saw she hoped she understood she moved there. Her stories aren't so much a ride as a dance. But this is exactly what leaves you feeling like you live and breathe with her characters.,2,2006-11-14 21:08:14
766,1320446,paraskivairina,Coot Club was a trip of nostalgia since it is one of Arthur Ransome's Swallows & Amazons books but this time set in Norfolk where I live. It was published 1934 but between then and the late 60s little had changed other than the luxury of a fridge on board the wooden sailing boats. Ten years later most of these boats had been fitted with diesel engines so that quant poles (for pushing the boat along on windless days) were consigned to history. The story is wrapped around the tension arising between the locals in the form of the Coot Club Tom and his friends who sail the rivers and lakes and protect wildlife and the "foreigners" who rent boats for holidays and tear up and down regardless of the courtesies of the rules of the road - which are there both for wildlife and other boaters. It's exciting funny and with wonderful characters. A couple of years back my brother hired a boat for a week's holiday and I joined them for a day and did the exact sail that is described in the first part of the story - and nothing has changed. Ranworth and its wildlife Horning and its races holidaymakers in cruisers being flummoxed by sailing boats criss-crossing in front of them the coots and moorhens nesting at the side of the river the boom of the bitterns... the stuck-up cruiser sailors with their yachting caps (and in the 60s their cravats!) and the women with strangely gaudy unsuitable clothing and loud voices. Oh it's all still there! I'd add that the main change which could stop this adventure happening now is the ubiquity of mobile phones but given we're in Norfolk and only one network works at my house I suspect that reception is patchy over the Broads so maybe you could still have this rollicking adventure of the local boy protecting the wildlife arousing the ire of the foreigners who pursue him all over the Broads causing havoc wherever they go. Maybe today's kids wouldn't be able to hitch a lift on a passing wherry although you do still see the occasional one but not a working one taking goods up the Yare to Norwich or down to Lowestoft. Should it best be viewed as a historical novel for today's kids? I suspect so. I had no trouble doing the same with Princess and the Goblin or even Professor Branestawm. It's a cracking story that rips along and got me thoroughly engrossed in it. I'm just not sure today's youngsters would enjoy it unless they have a keen interest in wildlife or sailing. And that's the only reason I wouldn't give it five stars. Oh hang it it's brilliant and I loved it - I'll give it five stars!,5,2018-12-27 04:47:10

771,18338465,pokrovskywx,Sempre trata de um assunto muito muito serio mas que nao e falado muito. Na verdade e o primeiro livro que vejo tratar da tematica. E faz isso de uma maneira completamente acessivel para diversos tipos de leitores sendo provavelmente sua caracteristica mais positiva. A trama conta a hist'ria de Haven uma garota de 17 anos que nunca foi livre. Sim desde crianca ela e sua mae sao escravas e sofrem nas maos do seu dono. Voce pode pensar que tudo se passa seculos atras mas toda a historia e na contemporaneidade. A vida da jovem vai de mal a pior ate que um dia ela e vendida para o Dr. DeMarco um homem frio mas que a trata bem melhor que seu antigo dono que era violento. E na casa de DeMarco que ela conhece Carmine o filho mais jovem e rebelde do medico. De maneira surpreendente os dois acabam se afeicoando e uma historia de amor cresce entre eles. Vejo diversos problemas no relacionamento entre Haven e Carmine. Nao acho prfeito e em alguns momentos tudo e bastante abusivo mas entendo que cada um crescendo das maneiras que cresceram seria impossivel nao existir abusos entre eles. Ambos nao sabem de verdade como as coisas podem funcionar no mundo real ja que nehuma cresceu no mundo real. Suas vidas sao cheias de abuso e violencia e a autora quis mostrar isso em cada parte da trajetoria dos personagens. Eles se encontraram para que um pudesse ajudar o outro a sair do circulo vicioso de dor. E um livro bem grande sao muitas paginas. Apesar de algumas repeticoes que considero um pouco desnecessarias a historia e viciante e a narrativa da autora muito boa. Os protagonistas sao bem construidos e os coadjuvantes tambem nenhum sendo desperdicado o que e bastante positivo. E como disse no inicio achei incrivel que o tema da escravidao nos dias de hoje foi tratado e com muita delicadeza e bom senso. O livro tem continuacao e depois do final que teve era necessario que a autora contasse o que vem depois na vida dos jovens protagonistas e das pessoas que os cercam.,5,2011-01-19 22:29:11

775,12369705,desmetkarin,Let me start by saying I don't like angel books. I know angels are real so it's hard for me to read a fictional take on angels. It really just doesn't interest me. That being said the book was just okay for me. I liked the second half of the story though. The first half was really slow and I had a hard time connecting with Jonathan. Halfway through the book the plot started to get interesting and more fast paced with some suspense. By that point I started to like Jonathan more and it ended on a great note which is why I moved it up to 3 stars. Just because I don't like angel books doesn't mean you won't like this book. Try it out for yourself and let me know what you think. Content Ratings: sexual: very mild language: none violence: mild,2,1967-07-16 02:32:19

Insta-love a jerk of a hero an innocent naive submissive heroine (even though here we can totally see why her nature is that way considering the girl was simply raised to not voice her wishes and to always always obey orders if she wanted to live and not be punished) little drama/obstacles for their relationship to develop unrealistic development of events etc. It could have been good.

778,18777580,ksayros2,This is the second book about the Burnside siblings although they stand alone just fine. In the first book Sam came off as a bit of a jerk but in this one we get to understand him better. His behavior is explained in a way that makes sense. I love the banter with his brother P.J. He's an interesting character and I can't wait for his book. Sam meets Nina while doing some volunteer work. She is a farmer and a widow. They have an instant strong attraction but Nina needs to take it slow while Sam doesn't really know how. What makes this book and this series so good is the strong emotions. The characters are so real with real feelings. A lovely story.,1,2000-01-19 08:14:49
779,18777580,katyabumerang,In Laugh by Mary Ann Rivers Dr. Sam Burnside is a control freak and the first thing he has to control is his siblings which he thinks that he can accomplish by yelling at them and fighting with them. But things are no always what they seem for Sam has ADHA and needs everything in a certain way or he struggles to keep everything in order along with everything running through his mind. Yet his siblings and others don't understand him which makes him feel like he is not doing a good job of anything. Now with his clinic about to open Sam thinks that volunteering at an urban green-space farm in Lakefield Ohio will be a waste of time. But in the farm he meets Nina Paz a woman that gives off more heat that a hot summer day. And a woman who with a smile and her flirty wit has him forgetting his constant need for control. Nina was widowed when her husband was killed in Afghanistan but she learned to find happiness again through her friends and her work in the farm. Daughter of migrant workers turned organic farmers Nina built a successful business by valuing new opportunities and working hard while taking care of her own. Nina is the only person that sees Sam as he is and she wants to help him and she does as much as she can. There is so much going on between them that the sparks are undeniable and they have their escapades while he is there. Only when Sam pushes for more than that Nina believes that she is not ready to for a man who needs help. Ignoring her wisdom and ignoring her heart which wants her to take the biggest risk of all for all. Laugh is deep and fun to read the characters are very introspective and will have you thinking along with them. It will have you laughing and enjoying all of Sam's family and friends as well as Nina's friends as they support each other and help along the way. Another great book by Mary Ann Rivers I can't wait for Love PJ's story to be available.,4,1973-05-25 15:00:59
780,18338465,dgemails,Review of Sempre 5 stars Sempre was a book that I picked up a few times before I committed and read it all the way through. I am SO glad I did. This unique story took me on such a journey. Haven and Carmine have led completely different lives. Haven lived as a modern day slave for many years. She knew conformity fear abuse and obedience and she knew the consequences that would come if she didn't follow the rules. She had no safety and no personal life. She did what she was told to do. Carmine lived a life of luxury afforded to him as one of the perks of his family's involvement in the mafia. He never questioned his family's lifestyle or what went on behind the scenes. He simply enjoyed the perks and lived his life. That was until Haven came to stay with his family. The pair never expected the connection they felt. Haven never expected a man she could trust or one that would respect her. She never expected to have free time or to live like a normal girl. But she had those things at Carmine's house. She also had Carmine. Carmine and Haven bond and fall for each other unaware of trouble brewing that threatens each of them as well as their relationship. With twists turns and a storyline that refuses to conform or follow HEA rules this book kept me captivate until the very last page. It made me think made me sad made me happy and broke my heart. Highly recommended!!!,1,1958-11-26 06:33:36
781,12330274,mraupp,I picked this up on whim at Barcelona Airport and initially I thought it might be the kind of nice children's book that's equally suitable for adults. I liked the writing style and the main (child) characters and the book features a rather original concept of what ghosts are and how they work. However the adult characters tend to be simple and predictable and I found the story development rather weak by the end. This seems odd because the author doesn't talk down to her readers in her writing style but she serves up characters and story more lazily constructed than I think she would do for adult readers. To my mind a good writer for children creates characters and plot sufficiently complex and interesting to engage an adult reader. I think Lauren Oliver has the capability to be such a writer but on this occasion she doesn't seem to have thought it necessary to make the effort. This book is pleasant and might delight some children. It's readable by adults if you don't expect too much.,3,2006-12-01 18:07:21

783,18338465,thelorena,This review first came live on: Thoughts and Pens. This is an overdue review one of the leftovers of my ARC pile during my long hiatus. I even have to purchase a copy because I wasn't able to download it. And I must admit that I only forced myself to read it due to the fact that I should still fulfill my responsibility as a reviewer no matter how late my submission is. I am very glad that I did because Sempre turned out to be a gem. It was everything that I expected it to be when I sent in the request. So I didn't know that this book started to be as a Twilight FanFic until today and it somehow scared me. I don't think I can handle a repeat performance of Fifty Shades of Grey. But OMG this book was anything but Twilight. The storyline alone was enough proof of that. There's modern day slavery here and violence... a lot of it. With this said I don't think Sempre will be for everyone as it's dark and messy. I wouldn't be surprised if some will DNF it even before they reach the second chapter. But in my case Sempre really connected with me in a lot of ways. Where do I even begin? One of the primary reasons I requested this book is because of the synopsis. Look at that. It's about the Mafia. And ever since I watched the Godfather I developed this crazy fascination about the Mob. The way they worked together their hierarchy the way they put the Mob first over their families are all interesting. Sempre made me missed the Corleone family and how united they are despite the odds. They are not good people...they're despicable (beyond redemption maybe) but I admire how they protect their own. The La Costa Nostra family in Sempre is also the same. They're f**** bastards with no hope of salvation....they murder they rob they enslave people... but when it comes to their women and children the ruthless veneer comes off and you will find insecure overemotional people who will do what it takes not to drag the former into the mess. Oh I am not saying that they should be forgiven... It's just that there's still good in there somewhere. So aside from getting immersed into the Mafia way of life another thing I liked about Sempre is the character development. Obviously because we're talking about the Mafia here there are so many characters to keep track of. And as you know a story with so many characters rarely succeeds in capturing the hearts of the readers. But Sempre did not suffer that because the overall character development was awesome. I am especially in awe with Vincent DeMarco Corrado Moretti and of course Carmine DeMarco--our male MC. The latter could really curse well. What a broken...broken boy. I do have an issue with our female lead Haven Antonelli. As I am writing this review I still couldn't figure whether to hate or love her. For the most part she maintained a passive stance generally accepting of her life as a slave. And I don't like it because I love feisty females. But I also reasoned out that making her the way she is was the most realistic course of action the author can take given the fact that she grew up as a slave. Well at least I get to see her finally making decisions for herself and debating with male MC as we go deeper into the story. Sempre's was also remarkable. I could not believe it either because the situation where our two main characters are in is quite doomed. Add the fact that this book is New Adult which as you know is littered with crappy romance stories that are brimming with incessant sex and kissing. But the romance in Sempre progressed nicely and the intimate moments were somewhat underplayed. We get to see how our characters handled their relationship even though it was dangerous...even if the girl was a slave and the boy was the son of the slave's master. There will be a lot of people who will think that the relationship is going to be unhealthy but it wasn't. As a matter of fact the relationship gradually turned them into better individuals. They didn't change overnight but you can see that they're striving hard to be worthy of one another. The plot was perfectly balanced. There was romance and action that made me interested until the end. Sensitive issues were also covered here. Sempre's story is not just about the cold-blooded killings the cringe-worthy slavery and the romance but it's about rising above one's baser nature... that even if our souls have been tainted with so much evil we can still get up and start anew. My only issue with this book is that there are some areas that are long-winded and will possibly bore impatient readers. Overall Sempre is a beautifully written story that took me on a wonderful journey... unexpected but definitely worth the 400+ pages.,3,1975-11-06 09:45:07

786,18071375,clifton233,*** Given the book for an honest review*** First let me state that if I could give the book a 2.5 rating I would. There really is not one major thing that put me off but a series of concepts. First being' that its kinda creepy that the daughter is lusting over her mother's fiance and vise versa. Once "together" you don't really get a relationship its more like they are lusting for each other. It seems that as soon as the mom walks out they jump on each other. Also the story line is very very predictable and it slow. I was ready to give up half ways through but I finished it and though there is a "cliff hanger" at the end you honestly see it coming. When I first agreed to read this for a review it was advertise as an Alpha Male book but Jake was anything but. Honestly what alpha male wouldn't go after his girl but instead pines for her from afar and instead get engaged with her mother??? None I know. Its mention that Jake loved Ana from first sight and instead of leaving the mom (who he was only dating for a month) and claiming her he continues to be with the mother to be next to her. Really?!?!?!?!?! The preview shows that the next book will be from his point of view and I really hope the author justifies his actions. I'm still on the fence on whether I will read it but we'll see.,2,2009-03-26 06:50:51
787,15156124,pallero,It had been more than a couple of years since I read the first two books in this series. Since this books involved the characters from the previous books it took some time for me to recall what happened before. But once I did this book turned out to be fun. There are a lot of things wrong with this book actually. So much so I would have given it 1.5 star rating if not for the fun factor in the book. There was just something that made this book fun to read. Fiona is an agoraphobic witch with little to no magic in her and a rare gift of understanding birds and animals. The birds have been warning her that something bad will happen if she goes out and so she hasn't left her house for a long long time. On the one day she tries to venture out just to go retrieve her mails from the mailbox she encounters a sad and hungry wolf pup. She takes him in feeds him and takes care of him. Minutes later a jaguar crashes through her window and tries to protect the pup from her. The jaguar happens to be the Therian(shapeshifter) Z. Z is a confirmed bachelor with relationship issues. So he makes use of the perfect opportunity Fiona provides to get taking care of the pup off his hands- he kidnaps her to be a nanny to the pup. Meanwhile alpha of the werewolf pack Cole has lost his mate and is drinking himself to oblivion constantly. When Jane his mate comes back to him alive but as a powerful succubus he is happy but hates the possible power tussle between himself and his mate. They realize that their pup is alive and go to retrieve him from Fiona and Z only to find that the pup has been kidnapped again. Cain the demon in charge of all demons incubus and succubus has many faults but he is loyal to his own. When Jane becomes a succubus she becomes a part of his group. So he takes Cole and Jane's problem as his own. These unlikely band of allies try to rescue the pup from his kidnapper. The reasons that the pup was kidnapped in the first place were so silly. There were many plot holes and uncertainties. Z was too much of an ass for me to like him. In spite of all this I enjoyed this book. I will still be reading the next book- Life Cycle.,1,2008-07-15 20:45:00

789,15156124,robben96,Zoe Winters you've done it again!!! yet another book that i just couldnt put down! I love how previous characters come back into this book. I was shocked with the twist about Jane and Cole though... couldnt believe it really... had to re-read it until i made sure i got it right lol it all worked out in the end though so i was happy :) i love Z. he's such a manly character lol typical bachelor life is turned upside down and falls madly in love. of course he'd never admit it lol. I love Cain in this book too. Couldnt stand him in the previous book but he sorta grew on me. I wanna see what his story is gunna be about and if he ends up with who i think he will? MUST READ THE NEXT IN THE SERIES! :),3,1976-12-29 22:36:59
790,11455127,martinuskowal,What would happen if your boyfriend offered to make your wildest fantasy come true? What would you do if the guy he chose for the third in the threesome was your ex - who you may still have feelings for? This book's premise is exactly that. And considering the books I read I was expecting steamy and sexy. Instead I got a lot of angsty introspective deep thoughts and way too much second-guessing. I finished reading it but the HEA left me unsatisfied.,5,1968-07-18 00:21:04

793,36242939,neelaeva,Read the full review at Musings Over Nothing Disclaimer: Thanks to the Author for the Review Copy of the book in exchange for an honest review. Waterboarding is personally close to me as does its author. I have read the book about three times even before it hit the editor's desk as a beta reader. This review is not gonna be biased in any sense so here we go. Ved meets with a terrible accident that causes him lose a part of his memories. He can recognize his parents and a few of his friends. Ved's life takes an unexpected turn thanks to the accident and according to his doctors only his will and resilience had got him back alive. Has this tragedy changed him as a person especially when he has been given an almost clean slate to begin with due to his memory loss? Are there memories that he had willfully moved away from and would those leave him to stay sane just as he had wanted? What caused him to erase a person completely from his life real and social life alike? Ved's friend Sara helps him recollecting his past. How far can you depend on one person even if they had meant the best for you always? Would this friendship grow further into love just like Sara had always wanted or is there something more sinister waiting for them? Read Waterboarding to know more about Ved's life. The story is narrated in three different voices over different time periods. Though this might be a tad difficult to get into for some the narrative is filled with dialogues making the story flow seamless and interesting. If you are like me 'havin-a-thing' for unreliable narrators and behold there are three of them in this book. The first time I read Waterboarding much before the release of the final copy I had to ask the author if it was a true story. The writing and the way the plot was unfolded made me feel that it was real. While there are too many smaller characters to keep up with they don't impede the pace of the story nor they reduce the overpower of the leads. If you are looking for a romance that is little more intense than the last YA you read Waterboarding should be your pick. It has the right amount of suspense romance and drama to keep an hour or three of your weekend occupied.,3,1990-10-17 15:05:57
794,35598457,panjan,Though I read lots of YA romance isn't my first choice. This book is a debut for Tirrell and I think she is on to something. The characters are flawed some more than others and they are merely trying to deal with life and all it's ups and downs. In addition folks the novel although a love story has no parts that are even PG rated. Katie the protagonist is a young woman who recently lost her mother and is on her way from Florida to Idaho to become reacquainted with her father  who flew the family home many years ago. In addition other young people are holding small secrets of their own and Katie is trying to get acquainted with people who carry as much baggage as she does. Getting a job learning to trust forming a community. This novel feels like real life and succeeds in making one want to read more. My only minor issue is that the ending after Katie flees Idaho for awhile seems rushed. The problems seem to be wrapped up faster than what was expected. I received an eBook of this novel in exchange for my review and thoughts on the novel.,2,2011-08-04 14:42:48

796,811726,matveev74,This is the firsthand account of one of the masterminds behind one of the most ingenious gruesome FANTASTIC acts of espionage ever. Ben Macintyre has also written on this (Operation Mincemeat) and lots of people have talked about the operation over the years (if you haven't heard of it seriously LOOK IT UP) but to read about it from one of the men who worked on the project is spectacular. It's also fascinating to look at the information he was allowed to divulge only a decade after the operation knowing that other bits have come to light in recent years. Awesome spy book and delightfully readable.,2,1950-03-13 10:24:57
797,27384500,kfgjxrfdthecmrf,Thanks to Helena Sheffield from Avon Books and Netgalley I received a copy of this in exchange for an honest review........ LIKE. SHARE. FOLLOW . . . DIE Freddy Venton is an unpaid reporter but would love nothing more than to be taken on and have a paid salary but currently has to make do with working in a coffee shop. She's quite addicted to social media (I've been guilty of this on numerous occasions who isn't!??) She checks her phone first thing in the morning to see what she may have missed out on on her newsfeed the night before along with all of her other apps aswell as checking her apps last thing at night too. She bumps into Nasreen Cudmore a childhood friend who is now a member of the police force and an ambitious one at that too but eight years ago these two young girls did something that was unforgivable. Now police officer Nasreen and investigative journalist Freddie are thrown together again in a desperate struggle to catch this scheming fame-crazed killer. The 'Hashtag Murderer' posts chilling cryptic clues online pointing to their next target. Their account is gaining momentum every hour as the number of followers rises but so is the body count. But can they stay one step ahead of him or will it be too late? Can they escape their own past?? This is the first book by Angela Clarke and what a debut it was I didn't just like it I LOVED it and it definitely didn't disappoint. There were a few twists in it which I loved as I was convinced that I'd worked out who the killer was halfway through but I definitely wasn't expecting who I thought it was. There were parts in the book I could feel my heart thumping so it's definitely not for the fainthearted. We are all too familiar with social media it's part of our daily lives whether it's Twitter Facebook Instagram Snapchat or Whatsapp the threats and dangers that these can pose and the way some people can use them dangerously to their advantage which sometimes cause tension rows and fallouts between friends and family. It really goes to show you that there can and are some crazed people on the internet these days and I'm sure we've all heard stories whether it be on the news or reported on social media. I am really looking forward to reading more from Angela Clarke and she definitely is an author to watch and I would HIGHLY recommend this book and especially if you're like me quite addicted to social media so don't say I never told you. I think I may have to check who my followers are in future just incase the "Hashtag Murder" may be following me...........,5,2013-11-16 16:24:05
798,15710450,qbuenicimo18,A beautiful introduction to Henri Rousseau's life and his dedication to his art in spite of critical scorn.,3,1986-11-14 19:35:51
799,2250580,maxguk,I found this book to be a quick fun read- but nothing else. There wasn't that much depth to it yet nor were the characters all that interesting. Which is very unfortunate as this type of manga (manga involving humans and androids) is typically interesting and thought provoking. I was very disappointed by this but just in case it gets better I will read the next volume. Also.. I've noticed quite a few reviews compare this to Chobits and Absolute Boyfriend and dismiss this as a mere copy of those titles. While yes it is similar (the latter are much better however) this was published in Japan first. The copyright information lists this as being released in Japan in 1995- years before the other two. Which means that they're taking inspiration from this title not the other way around. Just thought I'd point that out.,4,2010-05-26 07:15:38
800,15710450,disinter,I adored this picture book. I thoroughly enjoyed the interpretation of Rousseau's art and I loved most of the illustrations. I really liked the story. I was touched and heartbroken and inspired by Rousseau's life and experiences. This is a fabulous book for people of all ages who need encouragement to persevere in pursuing their dreams and goals who create or want to create art or other work who appreciate art and art history and/or who enjoy Rousseau's paintings and who appreciate nature and have interest in art history. While this is a children's picture book I think it will also have special meaning for adults especially older adults who want to begin a new endeavor and for anyone who has been discouraged by others' opinions and needs a bit of a boost to believe in themselves. This book would make a perfect gift for anyone of any age who has been told no or who has received rejections to their dreams or work. Very inspiring!,4,1981-12-27 03:11:49
801,2093969,hlyubovjbuh1983c,A wonderful introduction by Neil Gaiman and and an interesting foreword by the author got me excited to read this book but I admired it more than I enjoyed it. While I did smile and even chuckle at times it just wasn't my cup of tea. It was clever but in my opinion not that brilliant and I simply didn't find it emotionally satisfying or that entertaing. It was just okay for me though I did like it well enough. I'm very aware that this may simply not have been the right book at the right time for me. I think one issue is that I often don't like fairy tales. I thought I'd like this one though and I did. I'm just not wild about it. 2 1/2 stars,3,2008-05-19 16:33:23

804,18338465,doregon,Finally. I will say this book is more than a 3 star but no way a 4 star read for me. That is not to say that I didn't like the book because I actually really liked the story. But if I am being honest I thought I was getting more of a New Adult romance with the Mafia laced in but no. This is more of a story about the Mafia with a romance in it. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that I was just expecting more steam and romance. Where this book lost points with me was the length of the novel. The story actually reads very quickly but this story could have been told well with at least 100 less pages. Maybe the size of the book should have been my first clue that this wasn't a quick NA romance read. There is a second book and I wasn't sure if I would read it or not. It depended a lot on the ending of the first book. And without giving anything away the first book doesn't end on a real cliff hanger. Like I could never read the second book and be okay but with where the story was you know there is more to be told. And I am curious as to what happens to our main characters but I am not curious enough to pick up book two immediately. I will however eventually pick it up. I would recommend this book but not as a romance. But it says a lot about a story when I was expecting a romance but didn't get it and was still intrigued enough that I wanted to keep reading.,2,1989-11-19 12:09:46

807,15710450,awpebash,This lovely picture book is the true story of Henri Rousseau who wanted to be a painter. The problem was that his art was very different from the work of others' at the time and he suffered many years of ridicule and rejection of his work. Henri did not give up but continued to teach himself how to paint improving over the years. The illustrations for this inspiring story are gorgeous.,5,2017-03-18 12:26:58

809,18071375,BigLar,Received an ACR copy for an honest review. I was about to fall asleep in the beginning half of the books as the pace was too slow & less exciting for an Erotic novel. I believe the writer can do more with the Character as Jake & Ana both works in the police workforce. Definitely more space for improvement to made the whole scenario between Jake & Ana more exciting with dangerous & erotic crime scene. As the author already have some plot whereby some blond got kills. If the author can start off with a crime scene whereby Ana happen to stumble upon will definitely caught the reader want to know more & what happen next.Anything that is dangerous & forbidden can be really sexy & erotic :) I love how the 2nd half evolved & how the author kept the ending hanging for 2nd books development. Definitely there is more space for improvement & imagination for the 1st books.,2,2007-01-31 13:33:04
810,311799,bakbaura,Sherlock Homles owed every bit of charm to the great Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and here you can see Sir ACD giving his extra-ordinary art of story telling in the shape of Professor Challenger. Not only the stories had elements of pure genius more than a century back but also had pure fictional magic. Beautiful language and strong connection to the well defined characters make the stories unputtable! Though I am reviewing the series almost after 4 years of completing them still I can feel the magic of the amazing work!,2,1998-06-03 15:51:05
811,6670541,magometmerzoeva,'Inspector Singh Investigates: The Singapore School of Villainy' by Shamini Flint Published by Piatkus. ISBN: 978-0-7499-2977-0 Mark Thompson senior partner in Hutchinson and Rice is found dead at his desk one evening after he had called all the partners together for an emergency meeting. To obtain entry to the offices a key card is necessary which puts all the partners firmly in the square and squashes the partners' view that someone off the street must have gained entry and done the deed! Assigned to the case is Inspector Singh a continual disgrace to his superiors being overweight permanently dishevelled and generally not the biscuit. The only thing that keeps him from being thrown off the force is that he is the best detective they have. Unfortunately in this instance Inspector Singh falls foul of his wife who has been charged with finding a wife for Jagdesh Singh who turns out to be a partner in Hutchinson and Rice and therefore a suspect in the case. Whilst Inspector Singh exudes authority and commands respect he meets with less than approval from his wife whose sole interest in life is her good name in the family. As Singh's current investigation now encompasses Jagdesh Singh he is as she puts it investigating 'one of our people' and in her words 'I don't know where to put my face'. Singh wonders whether he dare suggest a paper bag but decides against it. This series is a total and unbelievable joy. The mysteries are complex and interesting the characters fascinating and Inspector Singh a larger-than-life character you so want to meet. To those of you who haven't had the pleasure of reading the first in this series just do it now. Highly recommended. ------ Lizzie Earlier books Inspector Singh investigates A Most Peculiar Malaysian Murder and A BaliConspiracy Most Foul,3,2003-12-04 21:37:08

Jason tell how he was ready to take on the world during his first days in the war. This ability to describe the battle scenes in Iraq. They are vivid pushing readers to feel almost see what it was like living in a warn torn country. As the story progress you can feel Jason pain and how it has taken a toll in his life and how it effects him daily. Just like American Sniper Jason story gives read that Military men have a sense of invincibility. The Marines Corp has the ability to take boys and make them into killing machines to protect their country family and what they believe in. Jason pulls readers into his world giving them an opportunity to understand why someone go to war and the physically emotional and personal toll it takes on everyone.

814,18338465,goldbond,WHAT A F******G DISSAPOINTMENT So I picked up this book because I assumed it was a Mafia Romance novel and guess what ?? The Daddy is a doctor/Mafia councillor who misses his wife . The MC our boy is just an Angsty teenage boy who has mommy issues and of course he is a bad boy ! You know the same ole YA bad boy of every high school YA novel you read - *The Jock and of course he plays girls too and I am sure he is a quarterback even if the writer didn't mention it . *The party animal. *boozedrugs blah blah but of course the writer wants us to know he has a "Gentle soul" and that we shouldn't judge him because of his Awful personality Anger issues or Insecurity! SOUNDS FAMILIAR? ? Of course !! Read the same description in 100 other YA books . HonestlyIn the current scenario there is nothing I hate to read more than Teenager Crap and that is what the characters are like . This is not a Mafia Romance . I repeat  NOT a freaking Mafia Romance at all ! This is a f******g disgrace to all the Mafia books I have read . I am getting real tired of cliched YA books in disguise of something unique when there is nothing special ! Like a freaking 600 pages of shit for nothing at all . Then comes our timid little kitten and our boy goes Neanderthal on her and wants her to talk to no man except her . This is probably the first book where I am more interested to read the Prequel rather than the Sequel because the Daddies here are a lot more interesting than the kids . This is basically just a Bad boy meets good girl and insta love sort of book so you might want to read it if you like that . Or maybe not on second thoughts because there are THOUSAND other Bad boy novels which are so much more BETTER . So don't read it at all . Just go back to sleep or do anything else but just don't read it .,5,1989-08-08 04:01:14

816,10098773,edivaldo,De Velvillige af Jonathan Littell er ikke en letlaest bog. Jeg laeser som oftest 3-5 boger om maneden det tog mig ca. et halvt ar at komme igennem de knap 900 sider. Det er en tung bog laengdemaessigt skrivestilen og temaerne. Forfatteren benytter sig meget af "stream-of-consciousness" hvilket resulterer i saetninger der fylder en side og passager som er adskillige sider lange uden afsnit. Dette er tilsammen med sprogbruget med til at gore romanen tung at laese man skal virkelig koncentrere sig om den. Temaerne i bogen er utrolig grove ikke nok med at bogen omhandler de ufattelige grusomheder begaet under anden verdenskrig imod joderne/polakkerne/russerne/de psykisk syge etc. etc. sa omhandler den ogsa hovedpersonens egen psykose (som vi isaer ser udfoldet til sidst i bogen) hans incestuose forhold til hans tvillingesoster og hvordan det i det hele taget har pavirket hans seksuelle tankegang og tilbojeligheder. Isaer i starten af bogen folte jeg en stor forstaelse for hovedpersonen en kulturel og dannet mand men tilsidst folte jeg kun afsky. De sidste 100 sider laeste jeg mest af alt fordi jeg havde laest de forste 800 jeg folte at forfatteren gik over stregen og at det blev for meget. De Velvillige er en provokerende bog en tankevaekkende bog men jeg vil bestemt ikke anbefale den til alle. Det er ikke en bog som vil efterlade dig med en god fornemmelse snarere en opgivenhed overfor sa megen ondskab i verdenen.,2,1972-08-11 05:44:41

Some characters you may love or hate but either way I end up feeling SOMETHING and that keeps me enthralled in the story. I enjoy Rivers' writing style very much and will keep looking for other books! Sam and Nina are well crafted complex characters that deal with real life issues and it's waved into the story. I had a bit of a struggle with Sam at first but he really came through in this story and made me root for him. Nina is a great character i could relate to her on many levels. The growing attraction between them kept me intrigued. All in all I enjoyed this latest Burnside story. Great characters plot and a good pace made for a nice day of reading!

823,16130164,3ziazila,Blood Warrior is the second installment in the Dragon King series. Here we meet telepathic Indranan Kavya and the Pendray Berseker Tallis. The Indranan have been in a civil war for thousands of year. Kavya is the Sun and she is determined to end the cycle of bloodshed. Tallis has been plagued by a woman named "the Sun" for two decades in his dreams. She has made him complete inexplicable even reprehensible tasks believing the survival of the Dragon Kings' depended on it. On the eve of Kavya's big announcement Tallis kidnaps her seeking revenge for his two decades of exile inadvertently saving her life from her insane triplet brother. What starts out as a active of revenge soon turns into joining of two lonely souls as the trek from the Himalayan foothills to the Scottish Highlands in an attempt to end an all out war and the extinction of a proud race. I really like Tallis. Since he made his appearance in Caged Warrior I didn't know what to expect from him. As a Berserker I was assuming this would be a violent brooding character. Instead I found him to be engaging comical and sexy as Hell. Kavya on the other hand comes off as somewhat reserved and aloof but she does have this tough side that pops up on occasion. Together they are great. The banter between them is witty and clever. The sex was sizzling hot and well detailed. As opposite as Tallis and Kavya are these to are a perfect match. There wasn't much back-story so if this book was to be read as a stand alone then that would completely work out. Since I have read the series from the beginning I did have to mentally pull out what had previously happened. The beginning did drag a bit but I think it was because I was waiting for the excitement and action I had come to expect from this series. For me this book really didn't take off until about a third of the way in. Then it got interesting. Not because of the sex but because the story really starts opening up. The pace picks up with more action definitely more twist and turns until the climatic ending. Blood Warrior is not necessarily the best book in the Dragon King series but it definitely well worth the read. I received this book from JeepDiva in exchange for my honest review. The opinions and rating of this review are solely mine and in no way was I compensated. Stars - 4 Flames - 3,1,1990-10-14 23:48:07

Secretly they use manipulate weather so that rain falls on areas they own that need it and dry out areas that don't. They do good works working in remote areas like the NE tip of Afghanistan helping to build the self-sufficiency of the farmers and bring them out of the stone age investing in infrastructure like schools roads hospitals. They do this all over the world. But the man who basically built and invented the facility a creative genius in the field named Greg has his own agenda. The company has been working with the Pentagon helping them by directing certain weather events to areas where it might help turn the tide of global politics. But Greg has his own agenda with the Pentagon once Flint decided the orders were getting too dangerous and were hurting people and he intends to continue it. But Flint finds out and send in Tess Beauchamp the only other person who might be able to run the station but who is an enemy of Greg's. They don't tell him that he is being replaced and recalled to the states until her plane is in the air. But Greg has a surprise in store. Long ago he started working on placing logic bombs into the software that controls the array in just such an event so that if anyone tampers with it it triggers massive weather effects including tsunamis hurricanes floods heat even volcanic activity and earthquakes. Thus begins a race against time to outwit Greg and his sequenced catastrophes. A thriller of a ride but plenty of technical information for the geek at heart. I recommend their other work as well.,4,2013-08-23 05:55:36
826,18338465,armanserow,This was just painful to read. Not painful in a "my heart is breaking this book is so good"; but in a "I wonder if there is something I can clean instead". In all honesty this would have ended up on the DNF shelf but I paid $9.99 for it! I never pay for books but do on rare occasions. This book had such rave reviews that I felt that it was clearly warranted in this instance. I was absolutely wrong and I assume anyone rating this book higher than two stars which is generous needs to be drug tested. I just finished reading this book and my body is shifting into self preservation mode by trying to erase all memory of this book from my mind. So here is my synopsis of the story: Man buys slave girl to free her but keeps her locked up in house with his two teenage boys. Brilliant. Player Boy falls for slave girl. Slave girls loves him too. Man is part of mafia but doesn't want to be and doesn't want that life for his son. Everyone does a bunch of stupid sh&t and slave girl is kidnapped. Player Boy joins mafia to get girl back. The end. The only thing this book was consistently good for was my insomnia. It took me nearly a month to read and would have taken longer had I not started rewarding myself with my kid's Halloween candy for reading a page. I would definitely recommend this for anyone suffering from insomnia and people I hate.,1,1968-02-09 04:36:04
827,18777580,altindish,Mary Ann Rivers never ceases to delight I've enjoyed every title that I have read from her pen and this was no exception. Using characters that are real with issues hang-ups and even their own particularly amusing gaffes in relationships her stories amuse entertain and leave you with a smile. Sam is a beautifully defined character with a boatload of issues: all stemming from his mother's death when he was a young child. He's compensating for that early lack of control with an obsession to have the final say in every outcome: and at a farm - that will be difficult. Animals tend not to take direction and orders particularly well and Sam's discomfiture with that fact and many others make him enjoyable to watch even as you want him to loosen his grip. Nina has had a rough patch after the death of her husband and leaving all that she knew to team up with a friend in a new venture in Ohio. Her loss-fears are increasing as her friend and business partner has been diagnosed with a terminal illness but Nina is determined to move forward and do her best to ignore her fears to focus on the what needs doing now. Effectively presenting the character's point of view while not stinting on the interactions between them Sam and Nina develop and grow as the story moves forward. There were also several inclusions that show the couple as they interact individually with other people in their lives as their own relationship grows and develops their other relationships do start to show changes as well. Though not without a few issues in Nina's often extensive navel gazing and a few moments where it was necessary to go back and discover who was speaking as Rivers is not a "said Nina" sort of writer did have me flipping back a couple of times: but in the grand scheme of things these were minor issues only annoying at the moment and forgotten soon after. You do not have to read the first in this series to enjoy this title (I didn't) but I cannot help but think if you are a fan of the series you will enjoy this book. Contemporary romance readers looking for real characters that leave you with a sense of 'I could see that" this is the book for you. I received an eArc copy from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.,3,1989-06-08 23:06:08
828,15710450,mirashi99i,This striking picture book is a biography of the artist Henri Rousseau. It tells the story of this man as he started to do art at forty years old. Rousseau dreamt of being an artist because he saw so much beauty and color everywhere. He couldn't afford lessons so he read many books to learn techniques and structure. At age 41 Rousseau entered an art exhibition for the first time. The art experts said mean things about his art but Rousseau kept painting. Inspired by the World's Fair in Paris he began to draw jungles. Rousseau kept entering exhibitions and kept getting rude things written about his art. He kept on painting eventually getting accepted by the younger artists in Paris like Pablo Picasso. By the end of his life no one was laughing or scorning his art. Rousseau had not just proven himself to the critics but to the entire world. Read the rest of my review on my blog Waking Brain Cells.,1,1997-06-21 12:24:08

831,18777580,hest66,Laugh the second book in Mary Ann Rivers Burnside Series. This time around its big brother Sam whose life is about to change upon meeting the vibrant Nina Paz. Laugh is standard Mary Ann Rivers insightful thought provoking emotionally charged humorous and profound. The simple actions words thoughts of each character reveals layers upon layers of who Sam and Nina really are. They're both emotionally broken while one seems to suppress feelings the other has no way of expressing his but they so click as a couple. A novel full of witty dialogue a hilarious date night and an extremely combustible chemistry between the main leads is enough to keep you flipping the pages till the end. I do not have enough words to express how simple yet beautifully layered this novel is but its definitely captivating and you suddenly root for Sam and Nina to find and share more laughter in their lives. *The ARC for this novel was provided by the publisher and NetGalley in return for an honest review.*,5,1985-09-06 09:41:23

The story takes place in the US the characters in the book are American except for Ana and her mother...they are British. The writing from what I can tell was written primarily using British lingo. I think it would have had a bigger impact if there had been a clear distinction for the characters. But I definitely couldn't put it down I wanted to know what happens next and HOLY SHIT the cliffhanger! Grrrrrr didn't see that coming at ALL...I really hope the 2nd book comes out soon because now I HAVE to know what happens with all of that bull-shinanigans!

835,18488643,ksyushakostko,I received this book from the author in exchange for my honest review. Thank you! What started in my mind as a police type of book change it course really quickly. This isn't the first time I read a book by B.L. Wilde but I can proudly say I love her writing style so much! She intrigues from the start keeps you on your toes the entire story makes you love how the characters are build and the best part is she will make you live the story next to the characters. In this book we learn that our main character Jade Phillips knows the key to succeed in her mission: sex and seduction. She has been on this mission for five years now she got from her informers everything she wanted and the bonus part she managed to create a fortune out of this. Her life it's going well. Being part of The Seductors changed her life in a way she couldn't even have imagined. But being as good as Jade is she got a new mission and that is the new target the CEO of a weapons company Oliver Kirkham. She thinks this is going to be another easy mission that she will finish it fast. But Oliver turns out to be different. With each moment passing they both start to fall in love and that's not good for them. Will they make it? Will they defeat The Seductors? This story really kept me eager to read more. The story is so enthralling that will make you hold on thight to your kindle! It deserves the best readers and you are going to fall in love with the characters! So go read Desire because you are going to love this book and the way B.L. Wilde wrote this great story!

837,25515988,kotek1311,This title is nominated for the 2017 Hackmatack Award in the fiction category. As someone who is both a born New Brunswicker an amateur genealogist I really really enjoyed this book! Betony our protagonist has been forced to endure visits with her great-grandmother but never really took the time to try and get to know her. That is until she falls asleep in her grandmother's chair and is magically transported into an old memory. From there she becomes intrigued and starts asking questions about the past. This uncovers a family secret and leads to some difficult conversations. This is a great story about forgiveness and the importance of family.

841,18338465,cy8,I loved this book. I am a huge fan of J.M. Darhower and I love how she incorporates more than just a love story in her books. This book has a little bit of everything. There is dark suspense love secrets a bit of action humor and pain. This book begins with Haven a 17 year old girl who has spent her whole life with nothing but her mother as a slave. Her life takes a turn and she is now living a strange new life. She entangles herself with Carmine a 17 year old boy of a wealthy family grandson of a past Mafia Don. Both worlds collide as they start to catch feelings for each other but can their love overcome all the differences and threats they face? The Mafia concept really intrigued me as it gave the story more than just a bad guy but an group of characters than pushed against the main characters. I reccomend this book to those who find the Mafia life dark backgrounds and complicated love stories very interesting. Oh and if you love Italians.,4,1975-10-18 08:11:06
842,18338465,ilyinston4ik,I was hooked as soon as I started reading Sempre. So much to love! Great writing great story and even a pretty great romance. I am sure a lot of the actions of Carmine and Haven are more appealing to a younger crowd (most adults can see the issues from the first meeting) but there is something endearing about such an innocent and naive relationship that I pulled me in.,5,2011-06-24 08:19:44
843,30300862,mzmccray,As a reader I begin a book with the anticipation of a journey one that will take me out of the ordinariness of life and into places unknown. On the Edge of the Loch by Joseph Eamon Cummins  gifted me this and so much more. The reader is introduced to characters that immediately seem alive. that makes you truly care about them. Very early on I found that I had become deeply a part of this story continually imagining the climax (with anxiety) hoping I had seen what lay ahead.....I hadn't. The book lived up to all the big expectations it built up in me. It's a journey of heart stopping moments and is not without romance and tenderness. I thank the author for transporting me to the edge of the loch. What a great movie or television series this would make. Characters and plot that would keep audiences totally engaged.

From page one I was totally engrossed in Pearl and Alexandre's story. And I was totally awed by Ms. Richmonde's writing. It's beautiful and lyrical--she writes great dialogue and makes the reader really experience the scene. I was in heaven when she transported me to Provence! And let me tell you the sex scenes are fabulous! After finishing Part 1 I immediately purchased and read Shadows of Pearl and Shimmers of Pearl--and loved them both!

You have Mira and Ethan the little suburban couple going to the cabin for her birthday when the boyfriend says hey remember that time you told me your fantasy was to have a threesome. Well surprise your ex boyfriends on his way over. WHAT? A bunch of freaky kinky stuff happens over the weekend with all three of them and Ethan gets jealous. Dude you set this nasty weekend up now lie in your mess. I thought the book was good but I didn't really like the character Rogan he was always like "babe this and babe that". His pervert character was a turn off. The ending was funny to me. Ethan was feeling insecure and Jealous so he punishes her by demanding oral sex in the dirt- Because that will teach her I guess.

I just didn't FEEL the chemistry between Carmine and Haven which kind of ruined it for me. But there was a lot that was good too - I liked that the storyline had grit to it and dealt with a serious subject (human trafficking etc) and the Mafia backdrop was grittier (if not a little too much blood and gore for my liking) too.

Ich muss wohl sehr schockiert ausgesehen haben. Fassungslos. Den Tranen nahe. Ja mehr als das. Ihr seht schon das Ende treibt mich in den Wahnsinn - wo bleibt der nachste Band? Immer wieder werden Katy Daemon und die anderen auf die Probe gestellt es geschehen unfassbare Dinge alles scheint auf der Kippe zu stehen. An Emotionen fehlt es hier so gar nicht es ist toll - ob spannend prickelnd oder lustig. Katy und Daemon kommen sich in diesem Buch ofter naher als in den anderen beiden zusammen und ich muss sagen die liebe Frau Armentrout weiss wie sie diese prickelnden Momente zu beschreiben hat! Leider leider wurde es aber zwischendurch auch ein wenig langatmig. Entweder es erschien mir als waren Luckenfuller gesucht worden oder es geschah einfach alles auf einmal - das hatte man besser verteilen konnen. Auch Katy trieb mich weiter in die Verzweiflung. Scheinbar hat die Tomaten auf den Augen! Permanent zweifelt sie an Daemon und dass er sie wirklich will oder sie sieht sich selbst als ach so schlechten Menschen und dass sie ihn nicht verdienen wurde. Also bitte. Naturlich verdient ihn niemand mehr als ich ;) irgendwann reicht es auch mal... er verhalt sich ihr gegenuber wie ein Ubermensch - ach was. Doch was ich ihr gut zusprechen kann ist dass sie sich von niemandem rumschubsen lasst und wirklich stark geworden ist! Insgesamt entwickeln sich alle ein ganzes Stuck - okay Ash bleibt eben Ash. Doch auch was sie betrifft gibt eine kleine grosse Uberraschung ;) Dee legt eine Entwicklung hin die... sie um 180deg drehen lasst. Sagen wir's so. Fur mehr musst ihr es einfach selbst lesen. Ich wurde diesem Band so gern 5/5 geben aber Katy und die merkwurdige Aufteilung von Geschehnissen und Luckenfullern ging mir doch ein wenig auf den Keks. Aber das halt mich nicht davon ab eine ganz klare Empfehlung fur dieses Buch auszusprechen! Es hat mir bisher am besten gefallen aus dieser Reihe :) Wie erwartet passt der Titel Opal hervorragend zur Story denn worum geht es wohl? Richtig - um den Opal und was es damit auf sich hat... und ich kann euch sagen es ist ziemlich cool! Auch das Cover weiss zu uberzeugen selbst unter dem Schutzumschlag. Dieser sieht so unglaublich schon aus und fasst sich auch wunderbar weich an zum Verlieben...! Band 4 Origin kommt ubrigens am 18. Dezember 2015 raus! Video-Rezi folgt...

854,13575839,sileas,Un libro dificil pero a la vez de los que te hacen reflexionar y plantearte cuestiones que yo al menos ni me habia planteado. Es un libro agorafobico que transcurre en una nave y donde se relatan escena agobiantes con una ambientacion muy tetrica. Se nota bien documentado ciencia ficcion como tiene que ser sin demasiadas concesiones. Te despierta la curiosidad sobre los trepadores y sobre la cultura extraterrestre. Momento grandisimo el de la conversacion entre el protagonista y el vampiro (Hay vampiros pero no son de fantasia) que te hace cuestionar en papel de sentiencia en la evolucion humana es decir hasta que punto encaja la autoconciencia de nuestra propia subjetividad a la hora de adaptarnos evolutivamente y que nos podria deparar una vida sin esa autoconsciencia. Me parece un planteamiento genial que nunca me habia hecho y en el libro lo presentan muy bien encajando genial con la trama y dejando un final perfecto. Lo recomiendo sobre todo si apetece leer ciencia ficcion dura siendo un autor que no se lia con terminos tecnicos y haciendolo entendible y adictivo.,4,1962-12-01 16:20:00
855,18301091,lordlion20,I have great affection and admiration for Nelson Mandela and reading 'Long Walk to Freedom' has magnified these feelings without doubt. It is impossible to read his story without feeling awed by his commitment to his beliefs and the sacrifices he was willing to make throughout his life to achieve the change he dreamed of. My understanding of the South African psyche as a non-South African was deepened by his honest and searching accounts of the extent to which apartheid and racial separation was ingrained in all South Africans not only whites. His experience of seeing a white beggar-woman and admitting that while he did not normally give black beggars money he was compelled to give to this woman saying that "to be poor and black was normal to be poor and white was a tragedy". This and the story of his alarm at boarding a flight with a black pilot as well as his experience of being in hiding and undercover posing as a serving 'boy' to his own comrades. Unaware of his true identity his own comrades treated him with condescension and distaste characteristic of the manner in which whites treated blacks and how blacks treated other blacks of lower standing. These stories graphically illustrate Mandela's belief in the extent to which the system poisoned the people and the change for which he was so willing to sacrifice. His love for his family and the internal struggle he constantly battled is an ongoing theme throughout the book. His writing style is sparse and straightforward dry even and belies the emotion he surely felt about perhaps his greatest struggle of all. He mentions his guilt about imposing the sacrifices his fight for freedom forced upon his family an absent son brother husband and father but does not dwell here with emotion. And yet his account of his mother's death was moving as he wonders whether one is ever justified in neglecting the welfare of one's own family to fight for the welfare of others. Mandela's court speeches press releases and letters are gripping and compelling and it's here that his written talents obviously lie. These powerful emotive and superbly composed pieces really give the reader a sense of the times an inkling of the tide that was rising and were my favourite parts. His talent as a writer in these forms are obvious and quite glorious but that natural style in the form of a 700+ page book doesn't translate so well which is disappointing. It does make this book quite dry overladen with facts under laden with the craft of story telling and makes it somewhat difficult to get through. That being said my preference for story didn't stop me finishing the book - I was determined to but it wasn't always easy and not always enjoyable. Perhaps he was too close to tell his own story perhaps a narrator more removed would have been able to tell a more colourful tale but that's not really the point is it? This is his story in his words and my preference for style doesn't change that fact. Whether you read his own account or somebody else's Nelson Mandela's story and his fight for freedom is one that everyone should know.,3,1985-11-11 17:33:15
856,18488643,fvptdf,So I just finished this book and I think my face is still on fire from all the blushing. This book is HOTT two t's kinda HOTT and it never stopped being steamy. Jade Phillips is part of a secret organization that uses sex like police officers use guns. They have access to anything and anyone and they've got more tricks than the CIA. Jade is the best at her job (which she states repeatedly through the story) and is riding high on career success until she meets her latest mark Oliver Kirkham (who is apparently a God on Earth from the way everyone flipped out over him when they saw him). This is not your "I'm in the mood for a life changing story" kind of book. Desire is the kind of book you pick up when you want to be turned on by what you're reading. Literally in the first chapter of the story you get hit with a VERY steamy sex scene and this pattern continues throughout the whole story. Now here's what struck me odd about the story Jade is basically a prostitute but she doesn't like to be compared to one Oliver is a pushy jerk sometimes but he's supposed to be the guy getting played. The author does her best to make you feel for Jade but also kind of ends up making you feel annoyed at Oliver and all his demands. I mean his heart is supposed to be in the right place but it's like back off guy she just met you! Most of what I didn't like about this story had to do with the writing style. The author is a huge fan of the word "fuck" and the phrases "holy shit" and "oh. my. god." haha. I'm pretty sure one of those words was in every sentence. Also everyone in the story was either muttering snarling or winking aggressively and nobody just kisses one another their lips must constantly crash together. It got to be very repetitive. All in all I enjoyed this story and I am genuinely interested to find out how Oliver feels about being duped! I look forward to the next volume in the series.,3,1981-11-02 00:34:30

He is quite happy in his work assignment in H&EB (Heaven and Earth Bound-kind of like an airport terminal director showing people which line to get into). Each post mortal spirit must fulfill one guardianship so he applies for a spirit who is marked for early death. That way he can come back quickly. Since he knows that his client will not spend very long on earth Johnathon doesn't read the handbook. And not knowing is a very bad thing! This delightfully humorous book takes your through so many human emotions as you experience Johnathon's antics discoveries and turning his heart over to God.

864,23626289,avrtrans,Was war denn das fur ein schnarchiger dritter Band? Ganz ehrlich...Da hatte etwas mehr Spannung und Geschehen nicht geschadet. Dafur weniger Daemon und Katy Geschmalze. -.- Ich muss ja ehrlich sagen das mir Katy mittlerweile total unsympathisch ist. Wie kann man nur so abhangig von einem Typen sein?? Und Daemon?? Muss die Autorin wiiirklich alle 5 Seiten betonen wie toll er angeblich ist? Der Typ ist dermassen eingebildet. Heilige Scheisse! Ich wurd ihn vermobeln...Dauerhaft. Das sein Ego mal ein bisschen schrumpft. -.- Wieso es dennoch 3 Sterne gibt? Tja..Das Ende war heftig. Der Schreibstil ist locker leicht. Und iwie gibt es ja auch ein paar wenige Charaktere die man mag. Und ich will eigentlich wissen wie es ausgeht mit dem ganzen VM und so. ^^,2,1967-01-05 05:25:21
865,30059658,derbendli,Pour resume tres rapidement : on suit l'histoire d'un tableau oublie. Un Watteau qui refait surface entre les mains d'Annie trentenaire fauchee et un peu perdue qui se remet difficilement d'une rupture amoureuse. Elle a achete cette toile pour 75PS chez un brocanteur mais elle en vaut des millions... Six mois plus tard : le monde de l'Art est en emois le cours du marche a grimpe des destins se sont fait et d'autres ... se sont defaits. Hannah Rothschild bien placee pour savoir de quoi elle parle nous ouvre les portes de cet univers tres ferme. Elle pose la question de ces << gens qui savent le prix de tout mais n'apprecient la valeur de rien >> l'avenir des institutions museales en pleine crise economique les oeuvres toujours "disparues" de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale ces oeuvres qui passent sous le manteau du marche noir mondial la mondialisation l'influence grandissante des Qataris des Russes et des Chinois. Quand on est millionnaire (voire milliardaire allons-y franchement) il y trois moyens pour se faire connaitre : les courses les voitures ou le marche de l'art. Cette thematique du pouvoir de l'argent est omnipresente et donne des reflexions piquantes a chaque dialogue. Car oui chers lecteurs tous les personnages sont fouilles complexes et diablement interessants! Enfin un livre qui nous montre que l'humain est un etre sinueux et que rien ne serait etre tout blanc ou tout noir! Le ton est espiegle presque satirique honnete et intelligent. Il est clair que le lecteur qui s'aventure a lire ce roman ne ressortira pas le meme. Un roman dont on ne peut faire qu'une synthese surtout si on etudie l'Histoire de l'Art ou qu'on touche de pres ou de loin ce monde percu souvent comme trop inaccessible. Pourtant la derniere page tournee je vous mets au defit de ne pas aller arpenter le musee des Beaux-Arts le plus proche de chez vous. C'est tout simplement impossible. Watteau est parfaitement choisit pour illustrer ce roman. Watteau cet artiste du XVIIIeme siecle qui pose la question de la grace et de la beaute insaisissable. Watteau encore dont le tableau (imaginaire) parle et nous confie ses presomptueuses pensees. Un chef d'oeuvre oui mais qui laisse un message intelligent. Celui de la beaute intrinseque celle qui enrichit la personne de mille nuances. C'est simple ce roman a ete pour moi une veritable claque. Pas forcement dans le style de l'ecriture ou dans sa narration (bien que le fait que la premiere personne du singulier soit utilisee par le tableau est particulierement remarquable) mais dans son discours. Impossible de ne pas sortir plus riche apres la lecture. Ce n'est pas un coup de coeur vous savez maintenant que je suis extremement difficile mais une excellente lecture!,3,1987-07-06 08:57:54
866,33551504,pyhome,Book 4 in the "Not Quite Eden" series and it just keeps getting better. Dominique Kyle's book The Way Barred had the usual suspect grammar issues. Regardless I became so engulfed in the story that at one significant event I shed real tears! I would love to see this author clean up the issues and open the floodgates to the book awards and accolades that she well deserves.,2,1975-11-25 03:05:06

869,30300862,rex5067,Funny that Goodreads should ask me to review my own book. But seeing that they have done I will add a note or two. On the Edge of the Loch is a psychological tale set in a tiny seafaring village in western Ireland. However it is not a typical rural Irish story as it takes in eastern and western US and Iraq. It's about people failing succeeding dreaming two men and two women searching for the fulfilment all humans crave; it's also about depths and dangers within the human psyche that are not often opened up in novels but which we can all relate to. Love is at its core in all its varieties and intensities along with the ecstasy and vulnerabilities it can give rise to. Writing this novel has been a long labour of love and now I am happy with it. Most of my professional writing has been in non-fiction fields though for decades I have taught and helped fiction writers with their work. Nonetheless after starting to write On the Edge of the Loch I discovered I needed a deeper appreciation of minds in trouble - despite solid experience in psychology - if I could hope to capture the 'truth' of each of the four main characters. This meant years of refusing to call it finished until I believed I fully understood the depth and distinctiveness of the characters. This 'spade work' naturally is invisible to the reader - so said a dozen pre-publication reviewers - just as the Coke recipe is to its fans. Finally I am still surprised by just how moving the early reviewers found the story. When a writer lives with a story for a long time familiarity can obscure the true emotional power of the words. Happy reading!,5,1993-01-17 21:34:07
870,23626289,sept77,Oh Sandwichbucher was habt ihr nur immer an euch? Dieses Buch war fur mich bislang der schwachste Teil der Reihe - eben ein typischer Ubergangsband in einer mehrteiligen Reihe! Der Kase im Sandwich halt - wird benotigt aber ist niemals ein Highlight.. Fur meinen Geschmack war auf diesen 450 Seiten viiiiiiiiel zu wenig Story enthalten. Es ging gefuhlt nur um Katy und Deamon und das eigentlich spannende und interessante wurde abgetan zwischen Dates Abschlussball und erstem Sex. Achja ein bisschen "Ich vermisse meine beste Freundin" war auch noch dabei. Die Reihe gefallt mir insgesamt jedoch immer noch ganz gut. Zahlt nicht zu den besten Buchern die ich je gelesen habe aber ist kurzweilig und die ersten beiden Bande konnten mich sehr gut unterhalten und waren spannend. Deshalb werde ich die Reihe weiterlesen in der Hoffnung dass sich nach dem letzten Ereignis des dritten Teils die Anschmachts- und Sehnsuchtsmomente von denen das Buch uberschuttet wurde im vierten Band nicht noch weiter intensivieren ....,1,2010-11-30 14:26:28

Armentrout hat einfach das Talent mir das Herz zu brechen es vorsichtig wieder zusammenzusetzen und dann noch schlimmer als zuvor in Millionen Stucke zu zerreissen. Es ist Mitternacht. Ich habe das Buch gerade beendet und weiss jetzt nicht wohin mit mir. Ich verspure gerade so viel Hass und Wut gleichzeitig.

I found myself wanting to delve deeper and deeper into Katie and Julian's story though if I'm being honest it was Gwen and Mitch that stole my heart and curiosity. There are moments in this book that make you go awwwwww! There are moments in this book that make you want to throw things!

The chemistry between them was intense but heart warming...I found myself saying awwww...so many times. This was a story of a Seductor spy/thief Jade with a secret mission to steal some valuable information that belonged to none other than multi-billionaire Oliver Kirkham- war weapon specialist. Jade is the top agent in her line of work- beautiful ruthless and never fails a mission. Taking on this new job was just another task for her until she catches her first glimpse of Oliver- tall dark and handsome. Will she be able to accomplish this mission or fail because of how Oliver changes her heart? Read and find out;),3,1965-12-17 22:11:34

878,16110527,amorsito04,Never. This word inspires Travis and Ross as they persevere through hardship and injustice in this mysterious western. When a shot rings out in the night two brothers find themselves in the midst of a mess far more complicated and sinister than they realized existed in their little town. With one brother convicted of murder and the other seeking to prove him innocent the plot unfolds into a Whodunnit complete with multiple suspects and double-crossing characters. The story unpacks into unlikely heroes faithful sidekicks unexpected enemies and even a very important canary! The story deals with important issues like not compromising even if it will cost you your life and perseverance in trials even when you are weak. The characters were rich and easy to sympathize with. The emotion and feelings were portrayed with realism not coming across as overly psychological but still making me feel every gut-wrenching moment of the characters' trials. I was genuinely depressed while in the mines with Travis! I do feel there could have been more reliance on Christ demonstrated in the story. This is really my only critique though! I heartily recommend this story for older readers. An excellent Whodunnit with characters of strong character and a legacy of no-compromise handed down from a good father. Please note: I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.,5,1953-09-07 11:30:30
879,18149639,gsjonesinc,I want to share this book review of Love's Miracle by Sandra Leesmith with you. Before I do I need to first say I think the book was incredibly well written. I will tell you more about that soon. But secondly I need to say in my opinion this is a book for the ABA (American Book Association) market. Love's Miracle by Sandra Leesmith tackles a difficult topic PTSD as it relates to soldiers who come home from action in war. Leesmith's gift of understanding in this issue far exceeds expectation. My father returned from war. My siblings and I knew there were times when we popped out of a hiding place and truly surprised him his arm could fly and hurt. Not intentionally. It was an instinct that could have saved his life during duty. My husband still has those dreams causing him to cry out. I don't know if Leesmith had the college training required for this topic or if her expert research skills is what rendered this outstanding very believable and heart wrenching story to excellence. Either way the story is very compelling. About the book: Margo is a licensed psychologist hired by Vinnie to help his brother Zane. After returning home from the Vietnam war Zane retreats from the family business to a cabin in the mountains. He refuses to return to his job and home. Vinnie and other family members cannot understand why Zane has walked away from the family business and why he doesn't seem to care about them any more. During Zane's time as a helicopter pilot he witnessed tragedies that seared horrific images in his mind. One in particular spiraled his emotions into a downward PTSD mindset. Margo's job is to help him work his way through the problem. Margo has her own issues which manifests themselves while working with Zane. This intelligent soldier saw through the masks Margo had built over the years. Margo and Zane develop an intense romantic relationship early on which forces Zane to seek help from another psychologist. Leesmith's realistic portrayal of the war scenes the PTSD issues family misconceptions and the romantic development produced edgy scenes. This is an excellent story to help readers who know someone who has gone to war. To me the real issue from keeping this book to the CBA (Christian Book Association) market is the issue of Margo and Zane looking to each other for their hope to heal. Please feel free to comment especially if you saw this book from a different point of view. The more we share with each other the more we help each other.,3,1998-04-15 08:37:25
