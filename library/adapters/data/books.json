While Nazi death squads routinely carried out mass executions on the Eastern Front, this particular atrocity was not the work of the SS but was committed by a regular German army unit acting on its own initiative. \"Marching into Darkness \"is a bone-chilling expose of the ordinary footsoldiers who participated in the Final Solution on a daily basis.\nAlthough scholars have exploded the myth that the Wehrmacht played no significant part in the Holocaust, a concrete picture of its involvement at the local level has been lacking. Among the crimes Waitman Wade Beorn unearths are forced labor, sexual violence, and graverobbing, though a few soldiers refused to participate and even helped Jews. By meticulously reconstructing the German army's activities in Belarus in 1941, \"Marching into Darkness\" reveals in stark detail how the army willingly fulfilled its role as an agent of murder on a massive scale. Early efforts at improvised extermination progressively became much more methodical, with some army units going so far as to organize \"Jew hunts.\" Beorn also demonstrates how the Wehrmacht used the pretense of anti-partisan warfare as a subterfuge by reporting murdered Jews as partisans.\nThrough archival research into military and legal records, survivor testimonies, and eyewitness interviews, Beorn paints a searing portrait of a professional army's descent into ever more intimate participation in genocide.\"", "authors": [{"author_id": "7049349", "role": ""}], "publisher": "", "num_pages": "", "publication_day": "", "isbn13": "", "publication_month": "", "edition_information": "", "publication_year": "", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "book_id": "19624684", "work_id": "27727946", "title": "Marching into Darkness", "title_without_series": "Marching into Darkness"}

We will only mention the railroad connection between Asia and Europe using the trans-Siberian railroad and beyond to Hamburg and Madrid as a competing alternative. We will also eventually show how backward in that field of container maritime commerce the USA are, backward as compared to the world and absent from the Indian Ocean and the China Seas as an actor in that container maritime commerce.\nWe will then move to the various organizations that have direct interests in the development of this hub and spoke network of maritime connections and routes in the Indian Ocean. But this will lead to the security problem to manage the movements of the ships (to avoid flags of convenience) and the various trafficking activities that are to be contained (human trafficking; smuggling weapons, military equipment and various goods; and criminal activities of any other type) with the challenge of who can do it and how. We will then see clearly the stake attached to the re-emergence of human trafficking and slavery in this vast area.\nThis security problem is central due to piracy and trafficking. Digitalized satellite surveillance will have to be set up for the whole Indian Ocean. What role will the USA and Europe play now the New Silk Road with the Silk Railway from China to Germany reached Spain on December 9, 2014, and the maritime Silk Road has reached Western Europe for some time already?

He wore gloves when he was asleep, and he wore gloves when he was awake, which made it difficult for him to pick up pins or coins or the kernels of nuts, or to tear the wings from nightingales.\nSo begins James Thurber's sublimely revamped fairy tale, The 13 Clocks, in which a wicked Duke who imagines he has killed time, and the Duke's beautiful niece, for whom time seems to have run out, both meet their match, courtesy of an enterprising and very handsome prince in disguise. Readers young and old will take pleasure in this tale of love forestalled but ultimately fulfilled, admiring its upstanding hero (\"He yearned to find in a far land the princess of his dreams, singing as he went, and possibly slaying a dragon here and there\") and unapologetic villain (\"We all have flaws,\" the Duke said. \"Mine is being wicked\"), while wondering at the enigmatic Golux, the mysterious stranger whose unpredictable interventions speed the story to its necessarily happy end.", "authors": [{"author_id": "16839", "role": ""}, {"author_id": "34161", "role": "Illustrator"}, {"author_id": "1221698", "role": "Introduction"}], "publisher": "NYR Children's Collection", "num_pages": "124", "publication_day": "29", "isbn13": "9781590172759", "publication_month": "7", "edition_information": "", "publication_year": "2008", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1439379552m/2093969.jpg", "book_id": "2093969", "work_id": "2099329", "title": "The 13 Clocks", "title_without_series": "The 13 Clocks"}

Garlanded with critical acclaim, it was named a book of the year byThe Washington Post and theSan Francisco Chronicle, nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award, short-listed for the Man Booker Prize, and won the PEN/Hemingway Award for debut fiction. But as many critics noted, Moshfegh is particularly held in awe for her short stories. Homesick for Another Worldis the rare case where an author's short story collection is if anything more anticipated than her novel.\nAnd for good reason. There's something eerily unsettling about Ottessa Moshfegh's stories, something almost dangerous, while also being delightful, and even laugh-out-loud funny. Her characters are all unsteady on their feet in one way or another; they all yearn for connection and betterment, though each in very different ways, but they are often tripped up by their own baser impulses and existential insecurities.Homesick for Another Worldis a master class in the varieties of self-deception across the gamut of individuals representing the human condition. But part of the unique quality of her voice, the echt Moshfeghian experience, is the way the grotesque and the outrageous are infused with tenderness and compassion. Moshfegh is our Flannery O'Connor, andHomesick for Another Worldis herEverything That Rises Must Convergeor A Good Man is Hard to Find. The flesh is weak; the timber is crooked; people are cruel to each other, and stupid, and hurtful. But beauty comes from strange sources.

This award-winning author has firsthand military experience and an imagination that knows no bounds.

In Lyonya, King Kieri is about to celebrate marriage to his beloved, the half-elf Arian. But uncanny whispers from the spirits of his ancestors continue to warn of treachery and murder. A finger of suspicion has been pointed toward his grandmother, the queen of the Ladysforest elves, and that suspicion has only intensified with time and the Lady's inexplicable behavior. Clearly, she is hiding something. But what? And why?\nMeanwhile, in Tsaia, the young king Mikeli must grapple with unrest among his own nobility over his controversial decision to grant the title and estates of a traitorous magelord to a Verrakaien who not only possesses the forbidden magic but is a woman besides: Dorrin, once one of Kieri's most trusted captains. When renegade Verrakaien attack two of Dorrin's squires, suspicion and prejudice combine to place Dorrin's life at risk--and the king's claim to the throne in peril.\nBut even greater danger is looming. The wild offspring of a dragon are on the loose, sowing death and destruction and upsetting the ancient balance of power between dragonkind, humans, elves, and gnomes. A collision seems inevitable.

Now, in an extraordinary flight of the imagination a half-century in the making, he takes us to a most wondrous destination: into the heart of an Eternal Family.\nThey have lived for centuries in a house of legend and mystery in upper Illinois -- and they are not like other midwesterners. Rarely encountered in daylight hours, their children are curious and wild; their old ones have survived since before the Sphinx first sank its paws deep in Egyptian sands. And some sleep in beds with lids.\nNow the house is being readied in anticipation of the gala homecoming that will gather together the farflung branches of this odd and remarkable family. In the past-midnight stillness can be detected the soft fluttering of Uncle Einars wings. From her realm of sleep, Cecy, the fairest and most special daughter, can feel the approach of many a welcome being -- shapeshifter, telepath, somnambulist, vampire -- as she flies high in the consciousness of bird and bat.\nBut in the midst of eager anticipation, a sense of doom pervades. For the world is changing. And death, no stranger, will always shadow this most singular family: Father, arisen from the Earth; Mother, who never sleeps but dreams; A Thousand Times Great Grandmere; Grandfather, who keeps the wildness of youth between his ears.\nAnd the boy who, more than anyone, carries the burden of time on his shoulders: Timothy, the sad and different foundling son who must share it all, remember, and tell...and who, alone out of all of them, must one day age and wither and die.\nBy turns lyrical, wistful, poignant, and chilling, From the Dust Returnedis the long-awaited new novel by the peerless Ray Bradbury -- a book that will surely be numbered among his most enduring masterworks.", "authors": [{"author_id": "1630", "role": ""}], "publisher": "William Morrow", "num_pages": "204", "publication_day": "", "isbn13": "9780380973828", "publication_month": "", "edition_information": "", "publication_year": "", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385943271m/1059682.jpg", "book_id": "1059682", "work_id": "1098703", "title": "From the Dust Returned", "title_without_series": "From the Dust Returned"}

Sometimes a thief, sometimes a vigilante, sometimes neither, and sometimes both, the mercurial Catwoman gleefully defies classification. Her relentless independence across comic books, television, and film set her apart from the rest of the superhero world. When female characters were limited to little more than romantic roles, Catwoman used her feminine wiles to manipulate Batman and escape justice at every turn. When male villains dominated Gotham on the small screen, Catwoman entered the mix and outshone them all. When female-led comics were few and far between, Catwoman headlined her own series for over twenty years. True to her nature, Catwoman stole the show everywhere she appeared, regardless of the medium. But her unique path had its downsides as well. Her existence on the periphery of the superhero world made her expendable, and she was prone to lengthy absences. Her villainous origins also made her susceptible to sexualized and degrading depictions from her primarily male creators in ways that most conventional heroines didn't face. For good and ill, Catwoman serves as a stark counterpart to the typical evolution of the history of women in comics, and in popular culture generally. The standard tropes rarely applied to Catwoman; instead, her adventures have charted an inimitably varied journey of empowerment and exploitation. Exploring the many incarnations of this cultural icon offers a new perspective on the superhero genre and showcases the fierce resiliency that has made Catwoman a fan favorite for decades.", "authors": [{"author_id": "7279927", "role": ""}], "publisher": "Chicago Review Press", "num_pages": "304", "publication_day": "1", "isbn13": "9781613738450", "publication_month": "7", "edition_information": "", "publication_year": "2017", "image_url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1486625240m/32713517.jpg", "book_id": "32713517", "work_id": "53293352", "title": "The Many Lives of Catwoman: The Felonious History of a Feline Fatale", "title_without_series": "The Many Lives of Catwoman: The Felonious History of a Feline Fatale"}

Feeling disillusioned, he cursed his existence and wished to be teleported elsewhere, to a more amicable world. Next, Jamie and his crew were on a space mission. Vaccines, rodents, male sperms, and female eggs were on board the spacecraft for experiments. An accidental mix of vaccines turned the skin color of their white and black subject rats to a glossy blue. While Jamie and his crew were in space, the human race perished due to a nuclear holocaust. They returned to earth. Being the only survivors, they began to rebuild a new homogeneous world and vowed not to let the flaws of the earlier world surface again. They took the same vaccine as the test rodents and their skins turned blue. Their offspring were blue-skinned too. Centuries later, the new world was populated with blue-skinned males and females. This new blue world not only hated black-, brown-, and white-skinned humans but also exterminated them. And then one day a Black baby boy, also named Jamie, and Pam, a White baby girl, were born into this glossy blue world to two different sets of parents through IVF that used, out of ignorance, male sperms and female eggs stored on board the centuries-old spacecraft on display at a museum. To save such odd colored babies from extermination-the law of the land-the parents managed to hide their baby's skin color with blue paste. With time, Jamie and Pam grew to adulthood. A day after they got engaged, the truth surfaced and they were sentenced to death by lethal injection. Their parents learnt of the vaccine that had first triggered the blue skin pigmentation and stole its remains from the museum to replace the death serum with it.

DEATH... LOVE... FREEDOM. THIS IS A STORY ABOUT FOREVER.\nHaven Antonelli and Carmine DeMarco grew up under vastly different circumstances. Haven, a second-generation slave, was isolated in the middle of the desert, her days full of hard work and terrifying abuse. Carmine, born into a wealthy Mafia family, lived a life of privilege and excess. Now, a twist of fate causes their worlds to collide. Entangled in a web of secrets and lies, they learn that while different on the surface, they have more in common than anyone would think. In a world full of chaos, where money and power rule, Haven and Carmine yearn to break free, but a string of events that began before either of them were born threatens to destroy them instead. \nMurder and betrayal are a way of life, and nothing comes without a price-especially not freedom. But how much will they have to sacrifice? Can they escape their pasts?

Ah, screw it. Desperate times...\nPanthers don't do responsibility. They don't do long-term relationships. They definitely don't raise kids. But when Z discovers a young werewolf in the forest, he takes him in, unaware of the powerful beings hunting the pup. Plus the little furball is driving him insane.\nFiona is a witch who can't leave her house; the birds have told her something bad will happen. The mailbox is as far as she'll go, but even that may provide more danger than she's bargained for. When a wolf pup stumbles into her garden, her safe, wrapped-up world heads for a free fall, especially when a sexy panther shifter kidnaps her to his cave to help him look after the pup.\nAUTHOR'S NOTE: The Catalyst is an ensemble book that also features Jane and Cole (from Blood Lust) and Cain (from Blood Lust and Save My Soul)\nZoe Winters' Paranormal Romance and Urban Fantasy Series: The Preternaturals\nEnter a world of dark desire and dark magic where today's hero is tomorrow's villain... or vice versa. Unleashed passions between unlikely lovers rage against the backdrop of a world of conflict and infighting among the secret factions of the preternatural underworld.\nAre you the villain if you've got good reasons? Are you the hero just because we're rooting for you? Tormented alphas, charismatic and ruthless leaders, and the women torn and trapped between them, forced into situations they never should have had to face.\nAmidst a world of ignorant humans, the demons (true immortals), vampires, and therians (shapeshifters) fight to keep their territories. The only humans aware of this world are the magic users: witches, wizards, and sorcerers who enjoy the ability to mix with the humans or the monsters depending on what suits their current purposes.\nIf the preternatural world is discovered and war breaks out, the humans have a chance... IF the magic users choose to cast their fate with their own kind. Magic combined with technology would even the playing field more than the monsters are comfortable with.\nDark lovers you'll meet in this series:\nCain: He's an incubus dream boat, physically, but it's nearly impossible to keep up with his body count. Any woman who comes to his bed is likely never to leave... at least not alive. But what happens when he meets a woman with a true death wish, the one meal he discovers he doesn't want to kill?\nAnthony: The vampire king. Cold, ruthless, undead, and hard to like. Yet, all it takes is one human with amnesia, to soften his heart. More than anything, he wants to return to a time when Charlotte saw him for the man he is, instead of the monster she's discovered. Ever since being bitten, she hasn't been the same. It soon becomes clear that the only way to protect a fragile human is if she's claimed. Meanwhile, his deepest wish is to have his lover awakened from the memory loss that took everything... not just the memories he meant to erase.\nCole: Alpha of one of the strongest werewolf packs in North America. His moral compass goes askew when he finds the woman fated to be his, and he can't resist kidnapping her. With the life of abuse she's suffered at the hands of the vampires, it might be a welcome rescue. But the werewolves have a worse reputation than the vampires, a fact that doesn't inspire much trust. Not your classic sweet werewolf love story. But being an alpha's mate brings with it a safety and security Jane has never known.\nIf you like Zoe Winters you may also enjoy H.P.

The polarizing Great Communicator oversaw many developments that changed the face of American politics and life-the Iran-Contra Affair, the establishment of \"Reaganomics,\" the largest military buildup in peacetime US history--and as such remains a figure about whom much is written and much has yet to be discovered.
